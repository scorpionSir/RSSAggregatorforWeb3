##  transactionfee.info (2020 version)

#####

Friday, January 31, 2020

The website [transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info) shows Bitcoin
protocol layer statistics. This includes statistics about Bitcoin
transactions, their in- and outputs, about blocks and Bitcoin scripts. The
project is a joint effort with
[Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/?utm_source=b10c_me) CEO
[@ziggamon](https://twitter.com/ziggamon).

The transactionfee.info website was initially designed in 2018 to raise
awareness about the inefficient use of block space by exchanges, services, and
wallets. Read about the 2018 version [here](/projects)

We iterated and released the 2020 version as we had reached our goal of
raising awareness and saw the usage of the fee efficiency checker decline over
2019. [blockstream.info](https://blockstream.info) can be used as an
alternative to our fee efficiency checker for now.

#### Contribution: Colab version of the Optech Schnorr / Taproot Workshop

[Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/) created a
[workshop](https://bitcoinops.org/en/schorr-taproot-workshop/) explaining the
Schnorr and Taproot upgrade to engineers. However, users needed to compile a
patched version of Bitcoin Core with Taproot support and download and set up
the Jupyter notebooks.
