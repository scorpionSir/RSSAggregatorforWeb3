## Liftoff Day 4 Recap: Storage for a Better Future

Today we wrapped up day 4 at Filecoin Liftoff Week. We heard from builders,
entrepreneurs, and activists across the Web3 ecosystem and beyond, including
Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, Pinata‚Äôs CTO Matt Ober and CEO Kyle
Tut, Livepeer founder Doug Petkanics, Carbon Five principal developer Hannah
Howard, and Jonathan Dotan of the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research, and
more. Here are some highlights from today‚Äôs ‚ÄúStore on Filecoin‚Äù events, and a
snapshot of what‚Äôs in store for tomorrow.

### üåä The Coming Wave of Video and Visual Media

Video and visual media were recurring points of discussion in today‚Äôs agenda.
Livepeer founder and CEO Doug Petkanics talked about Livepeer‚Äôs goal of
‚Äúbuilding humanity‚Äôs open video infrastructure.‚Äù Video makes up for 60% of the
internet‚Äôs downstream traffic. A tremendous amount of video is consumed, but
not stored. Petkanics emphasized that as more and more video-enabled devices
come online (e.g. cars), we are going to see a proliferation of video that
needs to be recorded, stored, analyzed, and shared. Today‚Äôs infrastructure
cannot keep up - societally or financially. From a societal perspective,
today‚Äôs infrastructure will continue centralizing in a few proprietary
platforms that will monopolize online video traffic. Financially, Web3-powered
video has proven 10-100x cheaper than alternative centralized options,
ensuring access to video infrastructure will remain open in the future.
Jonathan Dotan of the Stanford Center for Blockchain Research emphasized the
importance of ensuring visual media moves onto a decentralized network. He
discussed provenance and resilience as the most critical reasons for a
sustainable video solution, and emphasized Filecoin‚Äôs opportunity to provide
that verifiable infrastructure.

### üï∏ Making the Internet Whole

Today made clear an underlying and consistent message from the rest of the
week: Filecoin‚Äôs launch has filled a missing piece in the puzzle of Web3.
Founder of the Internet Archive Brewster Kahle talked with Juan Benet about
the role of storage in the maintenance of critical internet information. The
theme of the talk was that Filecoin‚Äôs launch enables the next phase in the
Internet Archive‚Äôs mission to protect all of humanity‚Äôs information. Antoine
McGrath and Bill Marczak - founders of [CRSReports](https://crsreports.com/)
\- emphasized that their mission to make available every Congressional
Research Service Reports is arriving at the next phase of evolution with
Filecoin and IPFS, which ensures the documents they are making public will
exist in perpetuity on a decentralized network.

### üîú Protection for (and of) the Future

As we near the end of Filecoin Liftoff Week, many of the talks and panels have
turned an eye towards the future. Brewster Kahle warned that we‚Äôre at risk now
of witnessing the collapse of open protocols and the preference of centralized
platforms. He urged people to invest their time in building ‚Äúblanks‚Ä¶but
decentralized.‚Äù Slack, but decentralized. Google docs, but decentralized. The
fireside chat ended with the announcement of Filecoin Archives, an effort to
begin migrating humanity‚Äôs most crucial information onto the decentralized
network to ensure its preservation. Jonathan Dotan emphasized the potential of
future crises in his talk ‚ÄúFrom Storage to Justice.‚Äù He began with the
Nuremberg Trials, which used documentation as evidence of crime to enact wide
scale justice for war crimes during World War II, the Holocaust in particular.
He compared those trials to recent violence in Syria, during which
documentation could not be used as evidence due to rampant global
misinformation. He described our current state as ‚Äúa crisis of truth‚Äù and
compelled all of us to ensure that emerging decentralized protocols remain
powerful and remain full of integrity to restore and protect justice for the
future.
