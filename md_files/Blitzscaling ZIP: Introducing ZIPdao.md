Last week we announced ZIP with the intention of creating a community driven
**Stable Crypto Commodity,** one that abstracts away the economic complexity
of tokens and allows for stable pricing of DApp usage across chains.

As a product, ZIP is completely open sourced and ready to be used by anyone
who wants to play with it. In short, this is a free tool for the whole
industry to make The Web 3 stack usable for the 99% of developers, and help
the DApps and services they build go mainstream.

If you would like to learn more about the technicals see the post
[here](https://outlierventures.io/research/zip-a-stable-crypto-commodity/).

Today we are exploring how to begin the process of opening up the governance
of the network itself, on a pathway to increasing decentralisation with the
protocols and token communities it serves.

## DApp interoperability across 13 protocols, today

Out of the gate, ZIP allows for economic interoperability for any DApp across
several leading token networks including:  

  1. Ethereum (and all ERC20 tokens)
  2. Fetch.ai
  3. Cosmos (via peg zone)
  4. Enigma
  5. Ocean Protocol
  6. Foam
  7. Chainlink
  8. Aragon
  9. Golem

For ZIP to practically work with any of these tokens it just needs someone, in
fact anyone, to collateralise the smart contract with that particular token
via a lock up.

And weâ€™ve only just got started. It's incredibly easy for us to make any
additional tokenized network interoperable with minor custom development work.
Just get in touch zip@outlierventures.io

With every token integrated into the system it gains immediate
interoperability with all other tokens, bringing powerful network effects for
both communities and developers. Meaning together we can grow the global pool
of developer talent and entrepreneurs building DApps. We believe this is the
catalyst weâ€™ve all been waiting for to make Web 3 and its principles a
reality.



## ZIPdao

As a community, ZIP is open and inclusive by default. It does not
discriminate.

In order to effectively align and coordinate a rapidly growing community
around this shared goal, we believe a DAO with simple, but well designed,
governance early on is critical.

Therefore we are excited to announce the soft launch of
[ZIPdao](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/zip/) on the Aragon Network. We reviewed
many DAO solutions leading up to ZIPdao's release, and aim to deploy further
innovative governance structures with other platforms in later stages.

The purpose of ZIPdao will be to mobilise a global industry wide open standard
in cross-chain economic interoperability, and the tooling needed to support
it.

ZIPdao will be supported by Aragonâ€™s suit of governance tools and aligned with
their manifesto to create and support global communities.

We are excited to be announcing its founding members over the coming weeks,
starting small but quickly rolling out partners â€˜Chainlink styleâ€™ ðŸ˜‰

If you would like to get involved please say hello via our [Discord
Channel](https://discord.gg/4ngq4ZW) or check out
[ZIPdao](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/zip/).



## Pathway to Decentralisation

A decade of Lean Startup has shown us as a â€˜startupâ€™ its critical you validate
assumptions before hardcoded into the system. And our work within the Token
Engineering community; that complexity creates fragility.

Our purpose launching the ZIPdao this early is to establish transparent but
effective governance right from the start, and a major criteria for us was
that ZIPâ€™s governance system is reliable and able to evolve to rapidly meet
the emerging needs of the network.

To do this our strategy was to first launch with a very basic and relatively
centralised version of ZIPdao that could iteratively transition to a more
decentralised organisation.

All voting power and access control rights will be delegated to what we are
calling â€˜ZIP Coreâ€™, a working group of employees within Outlier Ventures (OV),
augmented by the Outlier LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) 20+ members. As
the community grows, and more stakeholders will come on board, starting with a
group of advisors, voting rights will be distributed and more formal
governance rules and mechanisms will be established to handle the gradual
increasing complexity of decision making.



## Minimum Viable Governance **:** ZIPdao Scope

The initial scope of ZIPdao will be deliberately narrow, directing the
technical roadmap and operations of ZIP directly with its customers and the
underlying protocols it supports.

ZIPdaoâ€™s initial set of rules and functionality are designed to be
deliberately very simple. The hope is that as the community scales and the
complexity of decision making increases, more formal structures will emerge,
and power will be distributed across the community.

At this stage, all matters related to monetary policy and ownership will be
deferred to OV and ZIP Core, and remain outside the scope of ZIPdao. This is
primarily for regulatory considerations.

### Dao Membership

Importantly membership in ZIPdao is permissionless in the sense anyone can
submit a proposal for ZIP Core, Outlier Ventures Members and eventually
Advisors to vote on.

### Governance Tokens & Voting Power Distribution

ZIPdao has now issued 1 million governance tokens (ZGOV), which will be used
exclusively for voting. With voting power proportional to a stakeholders
holdings spread across ZIP Core, Outlier Members and soon a group of 3rd party
Advisors selected from the wider community.

As an OV spin-out, it will control the majority of ZGOV tokens and initially
have the sole power to distribute or mint more tokens in the future as it sees
fit to ZIPdao Advisors and the network of participants we hope start
collateralising the ZIP network. The remaining minority share of ZGOV tokens
will be distributed to ZIP Core.

### The Rules of the DAO

At soft launch, any member who has joined ZIPdao will be able to submit
proposals, create new Github issues and request funding through ZIPdao, no
ZGOV tokens required.

Initially, only ZIP Core and OV will be able to vote on submitted proposals
and Github issues.

### Value Flows

**Today, Phase 1:** ZIPdaoâ€™s governance tokens will be held by Zip Core (made
up of a mix of 5 employees and members) who will be required to vote and
submit proposals.

**Over April, Phase 2:** ZIPdaoâ€™s governance tokens will be hatched and
distributed to first Advisors and then founding members as they join and begin
to collateralise the network with further future distributions happening over
the course of 2020.

**Phase 3:** ZIP Core will seed the DAO with initial suggestions on ZIPdaoâ€™s
design, ZIPâ€™s technical roadmap, and network operations, but what happens next
is really in the hands of the ZIPdao as a whole.



## Get Involved!

If you would like to follow our progress please [visit our
DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/zip/). We would love to hear your feedback
and we welcome formal proposals to be submitted via ZIPdao for vote.

We will also be holding open weekly community calls every Friday at 3:00pm
GMT. To send us feedback or join the calls please join our [Discord
Channel](https://discord.gg/4ngq4ZW), or follow us on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zipWeb3).
