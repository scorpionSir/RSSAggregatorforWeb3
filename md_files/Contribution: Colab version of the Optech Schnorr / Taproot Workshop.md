##  Contribution: Colab version of the Optech Schnorr / Taproot Workshop

#####

Wednesday, November 27, 2019

[Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/) created a
[workshop](https://bitcoinops.org/en/schorr-taproot-workshop/) explaining the
Schnorr and Taproot upgrade to engineers. However, users needed to compile a
patched version of Bitcoin Core with Taproot support and download and set up
the Jupyter notebooks.

This causes [friction](https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-
workshop/issues/145) for users who want to quickly try out the notebooks. I've
[contributed](https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-workshop/pull/157) the
option to run the notebooks in Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook
environment. This reduced the setup time to less than 20 seconds and the only
requirement is a Google account. The links to the notebooks in the Google
Cloud can be found in the [Bitcoin Optech Schnorr / Taproot Workshop
repository](https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-workshop#google-colab-
cloud).

> Our schnorr/taproot workshop notebooks are now available on Google Colab so
> you can play with taproot without having to clone and build a bitcoind
> locally: <https://t.co/zfeH9YmrLO>

> Thanks to [@0xB10C](https://twitter.com/0xB10C?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for
> setting these up!

#### Bitcoin Transaction Monitor

Whenever you, an exchange or somebody else sends a Bitcoin transaction, it
gets broadcast to all nodes in the Bitcoin network. Each broadcast transaction
is represented by a dot on the [Bitcoin Transaction
Monitor](https://mempool.observer/monitor) scatterplot. The transactions are
arranged by the time of arrival at my Bitcoin node and its feerate (fee per
size). The plot reveals activity patterns of wallets, exchanges, and users
transacting on the Bitcoin network.
