## Filecoin virtual community meeting recap

Last week, the Filecoin team hosted our very first Filecoin virtual community
meetup! Thank you to all who attended and made it such a success. Our
community meetups are an opportunity to meet the people behind the many tools
and projects being built in the Filecoin ecosystem. On June 16th we were
joined by Ian Darrow who spoke about [Filecoin’s testnet
incentives](https://filecoin.io/blog/announcing-testnet-incentives/) and
Michelle Lee who taught us how to create unstoppable ecosystems. We also had
the opportunity to hear from Andrew Hill, founder and CEO of Textile, who gave
us an update on Powergate; an API driven solution for deploying multitiered
storage across Filecoin and IPFS. If you missed this week’s Filecoin community
meetup, you can watch the recordings here:
