## The misleading name, metaphor defiance, and awesome potential of "personal
data" — part 2 of 3

By [Philip Sheldrake](/blog/author/philip-sheldrake/)

·

January 21, 2019

[Read this post on
AKASHA](https://beta.akasha.world/#/0x872f8817ecf68ec4a5f940375a7900f9814da047/0xb8c4fabed9c1db9da29c9eddeeb5e074aea21c29003f266d4bd8c5ac66c4b03d)

[In the preceding post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-
data-1-of-3) I proposed that reframing personal data as interpersonal data is
much more appropriate, more useful, more valuable. I also asserted that data
is data — i.e. not like anything else. To support these points, this post
explores and dismisses the dominant conceptualisation of personal data as
property, and then reviews the less well-known data-as-labour framing.

## The problem of the way we frame the opportunity and problem

### Data-as-property

Let's linger a while on markets and the fundamental components of money and
property. I'm working on the supposition that cryptonetworking may be integral
to a future interpersonal data architecture, and given that Bitcoin is the
genesis of cryptonetworking, it's doubly instructive to reflect on money.

Money is attributed _value_ , but value is far deeper and broader than the
mere monetary sense — in the _money can 't buy you love_ sense for example.
Nevertheless, our current civilization is monotheistic in its veneration of
the market, and our first inclinations when grappling with any shiny new idea
is to see if we can't quantify its value and subject it to the manipulations
of Adam Smith's invisible hand. Despite quite substantial evidence to the
contrary, our idolatry of this mechanism truly marks it out as a religion
imho.

Sometimes free markets work best. Sometimes well-regulated markets work best.
Sometimes, markets don't work best.

The vast majority of our digital interactions are mediated by for-profit
entities operating in markets. This means for example:

> If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product
> being sold.
>
> _[Andrew Lewis, MetaFilter,
> 2010](https://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046)_

This isn’t peculiar to the digital age. The earliest statement of this ilk
that I can find dates back to 1973:

> The product of television, commercial television, is the audience.
> Television delivers people to an advertiser.
>
> _[Richard Serra and Carlota Fay Schoolman, Television Delivers People,
> 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television%5fDelivers%5fPeople)_

Nevertheless, digital media pervade our lives in ways that make television
seem simply quaint; the consequences are incomparable.

Motivated in part by the recent parametric shift of regulation, there are more
than a few parties out there looking to help you “take back control” of your
data and monetize it. For example:

  * [Bitclave](https://www.bitclave.com/) “blockchain-based decentralized marketplace”
  * [Datacoup](https://datacoup.com/) “sell your anonymous data for real, cold hard cash”
  * [Datawallet](https://datawallet.com/) “get paid when you share your data”
  * [Datum](https://datum.org/) “monetize your digital life”
  * [Enigma](https://enigma.co/) “users can collectively and independently monetize their data”
  * [Hu-manity](https://hu-manity.co/) “participate in the human data marketplace”
  * [Madana](https://www.madana.io/) “market for data analysis”
  * [Metame](http://metame.co/) “enrich your life with your data”
  * [Opiria](https://opiria.io/) “earn money with your data”
  * [People.io](https://people.io/) "connect with the value of your data"
  * [Sun](https://suntoken.io) “for data ownership and privacy … and monetization”
  * [Truth Data Cloud](https://truth.tech/) “Your data. Rewarded”

The rationale appears straightforward. Some high-profile companies have
generated significant revenues and accrued substantial market values from
developing products and services that create, harvest, and process personal
data. The market has therefore awarded personal data monetary value, and if we
now get the kind of control over it a regulation such as the GDPR requires,
then we can own it and sell it.

> Data is the new oil.
>
> _[Clive
> Humby](http://ana.blogs.com/maestros/2006/11/data%5fis%5fthe%5fnew.html)_

Ka-ching!

Except that oil is rivalrous (its consumption by one consumer prevents
simultaneous consumption by other consumers), whereas data is naturally non-
rivalrous and quite possibly [anti-
rivalrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-rival_good) in some contexts
(where the value is all the greater the more it's shared around). Moreover, do
you really own [the light reflected from your
face](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/google-defeats-biometric-
privacy-lawsuit-on-article-iii-standing-grounds.html), or the fact that you
have roots in a specific ethnic group? No. Nevertheless, you should expect not
to have this information used discriminately. Light reflected is one thing;
its analysis and association with your identity (facial recognition) is quite
another, let alone the actual application of such information.

Many of these "monetize your data" projects have been inspired by [Project
VRM](http://projectvrm.org/), albeit with the urgency of a corresponding
business model not necessarily integral to the VRM (vendor relationship
management) vision. VRM tools are customers’ counterpart to vendors’ customer
relationship management (CRM) systems. VRM tools give customers greater
control; as the sub-title of the book _The Intention Economy_ puts it, it’s
_When Customers Take Charge_. With such tools:

> ... liberated customers enjoy full agency for themselves and employ agents
> who respect and apply the powers that customers grant them.
>
> _Doc Searls, The Intention Economy, 2012 ([check your
> library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/intention-economy-when-customers-
> take-charge/oclc/934102252))_

VRM calls the customer the first party. The second party is the vendor. The
third party is vendor-driven, and on the vendor’s side. The fourth party is
customer-driven, and on the customer’s side. And while the fourth party tools
have been labelled customertech, we can generalise the role beyond that of
customer to, say, citizen, or any role the individual might occupy. In his
book, Doc places significant emphasis on personal agency, albeit still in the
context of markets if only to catalyse a market response somehow.

> Agency is personal. It is the source of confidence behind all intention. By
> its nature, the networked marketplace welcomes full agency for customers.

Despite such clues, too many have constrained their imaginations, ignored
agency, and jumped on the monetize-your-data train. I was similarly
[guilty](https://www.philipsheldrake.com/2011/11/the-uk-takes-a-step-closer-
to-streams-banks/) on writing _The Business of Influence_ nearly a decade ago.

Doc had previously co-authored _The Cluetrain_ — way back in 1999 — and
despite self-quoting in _The Intention Economy_ , too many it seems do not see
beyond a binary world of big organizations and little people connected by
market transactions.

> For thousands of years, we knew exactly what markets were: conversations
> between people who sought out others who shared the same interests. …
> Conversation is a profound act of humanity. So once were markets.
>
> _[The Cluetrain](http://cluetrain.com/)_

And if that wasn’t a big enough hint, this last year:

> Looking at VRM or customertech [market] opportunities through the prism of
> data is to borrow tarnished optics from exactly the creatures and systems
> [advertising tech] we don’t want in the room to start out with if we’re
> going to do this thing right.
>
> _[Doc Searls, ProjectVRM mailing
> list](https://cyber.harvard.edu/lists/arc/projectvrm/2017-10/msg00073.html)_

Yet just when we begin to contemplate the miserable failure a market for
personal data represents, it can go lower still. Where there are transactions
in the world of finance, there is
[securitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization) — it is part
and parcel of the financialization at capitalism’s extreme. There is [a
nascent Political Action Committee](https://twitter.com/personaldatapac)
([PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee)) in the US
dedicated to this assertion:

> Every place that data is transacted, is an opportunity to index. And every
> index is an opportunity for securitization and risk management.
>
> _[James Felton
> Keith](https://cyber.harvard.edu/lists/arc/projectvrm/2018-02/msg00119.html)_

John Stuart Mill, the 19th Century British philosopher and political
economist, worried that capitalism’s pressure to accumulate money could lead
to a “tyranny of conformity,” a resignation that an improved system couldn’t
be found. He feared the middle classes in the US and other countries had
succumbed to such conformity, displaying:

> ... a general indifference to those kinds of knowledge and mental culture
> which cannot be immediately converted into pounds, shillings and pence.
>
> _[John Stuart
> Mill](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94FFAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA375&ots=v3gc8NjV%5fp&dq=%22general%20indifference%20to%20those%20kinds%20of%20knowledge%20and%20mental%20culture%20which%20cannot%20be%20immediately%20converted%20into%20pounds%2C%20shillings%20and%20pence.%22&pg=PA375#v=onepage&q=%22general%20indifference%20to%20those%20kinds%20of%20knowledge%20and%20mental%20culture%20which%20cannot%20be%20immediately%20converted%20into%20pounds,%20shillings%20and%20pence.%22&f=false)_

And here we remain. Conforming. Compliant. Wondering if there might be a
better way.

The securitization of personal data is wholly unlike any fabric of a co-
operative and civilized society I recognise or wish to help build. Do we
really want to reduce this fantastical digital facility to a question of data
ownership and market participation? Seriously, is that the best we can do? We
need to design a resistance to the siren calls of the market in favour of
something more valuable.

Shouldn't we raise questions of identity and agency and collective
intelligence and ethics rather than securitization and markets? Should we not
strive to offer and derive unquantifiable value in all combination of
wonderful variety and purpose rather than construct a simplistic mechanism by
which someone might package up the personal data equivalent of a
[collateralized debt
obligation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation)?

The venture capital [mindset](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/disrupting-
disruptors-lawrence-lundy-bryan/) inevitably perceives a data marketplace in
terms of providing economic incentive for the more efficient allocation of
data. But efficiency is merely first order, transactional. Effectiveness is
second order, transformational. That didn’t stop one VC firm running the
numbers though, [concluding](https://www.afr.com/technology/social-
media/facebook/how-much-is-your-personal-data-really-worth-20180413-h0yplv)
that even the mighty Facebook only manages to make your account worth about
twenty bucks per annum.

How much is that six cents a day worth to you? Is it sufficient remuneration
to allow others to continue construction of their ‘[data
doubles](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF3700/v17/bakgrunnsnotat/the_surveillant_assemblage.pdf)’
of you, designed to answer their questions about you more _efficiently_ to
varying degrees of (in)accuracy, eroding your agency in the process?

No.

Interestingly, Professor Alex Pentland writes:

> [Social physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_physics) strongly
> suggest that the [Adam Smith’s] invisible hand is more due to trust,
> cooperation and robustness properties of the person-to-person network of

>
> _[Alex Pentland, Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/tech-
> shouldnt-built-free-markets-needs-based-exchanges/)_

Pentland has also [mooted](https://www.theguardian.com/media-
network/2015/mar/25/google-sandy-pentland-separate-organisation-data) the
potential for Google to cleave in two, with one part dedicated to providing a
regulated bank-like service for data.

Personal data isn’t money as we know it. Simplistic. Transactional. Binary. It
is more akin to the rich, varied and complex information flows present in
rainforests, in oceans, in human cultures. It is worth a lot more than six
cents a day when markets don’t reduce it and its application to a mere
transactional exchange. At the very moment we might conceive an awesome,
distributed and continuous crystallization of collective knowledge, the
signalling known as price entails monumental information loss and inevitable
consequential inequalities.

If anything, rather than reducing personal data to mere money at such great
loss, we might elevate money.

### Data-as-labour

Jaron Lanier describes the thinking behind data-as-labour:

> It’s magic that you can upload a phrase in Spanish into the cloud services
> of companies like Google or Microsoft, and a workable, if imperfect,
> translation to English is returned. It’s as if there’s a polyglot artificial
> intelligence residing up there in the great cloud server farms.
>
> But that is not how cloud services work. Instead, a multitude of examples of
> translations made by real human translators are gathered over the Internet.
> These are correlated with the example you send for translation. It will
> almost always turn out that multiple previous translations by real human
> translators had to contend with similar passages, so a collage of those
> previous translation will yield a usable result.
>
> … With each so-called automatic translation, the humans who were the sources
> of the data are inched away from the world of compensation and employment.
>
> _Jaron Lanier,[Who Owns the
> Future?](http://www.jaronlanier.com/futurewebresources.html) ([check your
> library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/who-owns-the-
> future/oclc/964934205))_

And given that labour is sold and bought in markets:

> In the event that something a person says or does contributes even minutely
> to a database that allows, say, a machine language translation algorithm, or
> a market prediction algorithm, to perform a task, then a nanopayment,
> proportional _both_ to the degree of contribution _and_ the resultant value,
> will be due to the person. … A market economy should not just be about
> ‘businesses,’ but about everyone who contributes value.

To be clear, Lanier sees some folly here. Nevertheless, he takes it seriously
enough to return to the topic in a recent jointly-authored paper — [Should We
Treat Data as Labor?](https://clubsicomoro.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DAL-
DATA-AS-LABOUR-SSRN-id3093683.pdf) — framed in terms of popular concern for
employment and income distribution in this digital age.

It’s distinguished from the current model:

Issue| Current model| Data as labour  
---|---|---  
Ownership| Corporate| Individual  
Incentives| Entrepreneurship| “Ordinary” contributions  
Future of work| Universal Basic Income| Data work  
Source of self-esteem| Beyond work| Digital dignity  
Social contract| Free services for free data| Countervailing power to create
data labor market  
  
This work’s value is in the questions it asks, but not in its answers. Here’s
what’s wrong.

Data-as-labour is effectively a rebadging of data as property — one _owns_
one's labour after all. Labour is remunerated based on time and/or output at a
market value. Here, the value is contingent on factors way beyond any
conceptualization of work that I know. The shoehorning simply serves to
connect the treatment of personal and similar data to concerns for the impact
on employment of all variety of digital technologies, not least artificial
intelligence. That might be honourable, but it’s also tenuous at best.

Moreover, it seems I must privatize the value of my data if others privatize
the value derived thereof. The authors justify this on the basis that
artificial intelligence is centralized, but it need not be of course. They
also assume that price remains the best way to signal and derive value in this
context, yet perhaps we should test other options before reaching such a
conclusion.

Finally, while the authors acknowledge an inevitable decline in value (after a
while, yet another human translation adds next to nothing to the accuracy of
the cloud translation service), they don’t acknowledge that Deepmind’s AlphaGo
Zero has been [teaching itself without human-originated
data](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270).

The question remains, is there a better way to frame “personal data”?

The [third and final post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/23/interpersonal-
data-3-of-3) explores the conceptualizations of data-as-reputation, data-as-
public-good, and data-as-me, before pointing to some architectural principles
for a new direction suggested in the first post of this series – interpersonal
data.
