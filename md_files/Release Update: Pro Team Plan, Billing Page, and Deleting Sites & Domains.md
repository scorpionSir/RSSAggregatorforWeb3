## Enhancements

### Concurrent builds

You can build multiple deployments at the same time within one site and across
all sites.

### Domain Checkout

The domain checkout process is now charged to your added payment method
instead of having to type in your payment details for each one time check out.

### List of Sites and Deploys

Pagination has been added to the list of sites and lists of deploys. You may
have noticed if you had more than 20 sites and/or deploys they get cut off,
now you will be able to load as many as you need.

## Bug Fixes

  * Sometimes after a successful deployment the autogenerated subdomain to preview the deployment wouldn’t show until after a refresh. Fixed!
  * The date and time on a previous deployment were showing up as “today MM/DD” if the deployment was within the past 24 hrs, even if the deployment was yesterday. Fixed!
  * The same Git Repository connected to multiple sites sometimes failed to trigger the auto-deploy. Fixed!
  * In case the manual trigger of a redeploy fails, we improved the error message to explain why it did.
