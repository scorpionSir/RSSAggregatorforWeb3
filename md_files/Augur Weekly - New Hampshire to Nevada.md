> ###  **Election Betting Roundup**

New Hampshire was significantly less eventful than Iowa. Bernie Sanders won
with no controversy.

 _`Maybe that’s okay.`_

Despite the lack of madness, the contest was somehow even tighter than Iowa.
The tightest contest in a New Hampshire Democratic Primary _ever_.

[![Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4dae28a9-590d-4bb6-a290-c6622b6617b6_680x491.png)](https://twitter.com/JohnSpall247/status/1227659511424585729)

Despite the close race, from a betting perspective, this one was a bit of a
snoozer. Sanders was a favorite at ~75c or better since late January, and the
candidates that were expected to give him a run, Warren and Biden, have
national campaigns that are fizzling fast.

Prior to the NH primary, the betting markets seemed to have New Hampshire
pegged a little closer than the robots.

#### Nevada

Up next is Nevada’s contest on Feb 22.

 **Currently, PredictIt has odds of:**

Sanders - 75c  
Biden - 15c (!?)  
Buttigieg - 11c  
Klobuchar - 4c  
Steyer - 3c  
Warren - 2c

Meanwhile, as the primaries and caucuses begin to take place, it’s interesting
to see how the Sanders momentum is affecting the odds for the general
election.

It looks as though the betting markets believe DJT is the favorite to re-claim
the presidency at this point.
