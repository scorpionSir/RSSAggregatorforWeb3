#### If trading politics is your thing, strap in.

Recently, there has been an uptick in podcasts focused specifically on placing
(and profiting from) political bets and trades.

During the 2016 election cycle, there was only one such podcast, _Election
Profit Makers_. This cycle, four separate podcasts, including _EPM_ , have
emerged to serve the needs of those looking for an edge in trading politics.

One highlight of these shows is the hosts and guests are all making real-money
wagers on political markets in real-time. Follow along to hear first-hand
trading ideas.

### The Political Trade

The **Political Trade Podcast** (TPT) is the newest newcomer to the group,
having just launched this February.

TPT is a product of **[Tastytrade](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/)** and
**[Luckbox Magazine](https://luckboxmagazine.com/)** and is hosted by Jeff
Joseph.

These guys have a prolific release schedule and have managed to lure enticing
guests such as top political traders, political strategist James Carville,
former White House aid Anthony Scaramucci, and PredictIt founder John
Aristotle.

 **Recent Episode:** James Carville: Political Bets and Bracketology

### Old Bull TV

 **[Old Bull TV](https://twitter.com/OldBullTV)** is another newcomer to the
political trading media space. Hosted by former PredictIt marketer, [Flip
Pidot](https://twitter.com/flippidot), OBTV weaves through the ins and outs of
political events while discussing the trading implications.

Flip has a place in our hearts for his relentless dragging of modeling-centric
political commentators; who run websites with numerical monikers and bash the
predictive power of markets.

Read to the end for information on an Old Bull TV-sponsored special event for
political traders happening TODAY (Friday, April 23rd).

The **[Star-Spangled Gamblers](https://starspangledgamblers.com/)** blog,
penned by Alex “[Keendawg](https://twitter.com/keendawgSSG)” Saunders is an
irreverent take on the political trading lifestyle.

Don’t let the humor fool you. Star-Spangled Gamblers isn’t short on analysis
and trading ideas, and the podcast serves as an extension of the blog in this
regard. Keendawg shines in either solo or group work; occasionally bringing on
the trader as a guest. He’ll be sure to leave you with a profitable trade and
a sore gut.
