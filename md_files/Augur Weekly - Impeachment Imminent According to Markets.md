> ####  **`Political Betting Roundup`**

After hearings on the alleged Trump/Ukraine quid-pro-quo corruption scandal,
betting markets believe that impeachment is an inevitable conclusion, with
‘YES’ in PredictIt’s 1st term impeachment market climbing as high as
.90/share. This is an interesting figure at this stage.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9e7b471-d6bc-49cc-b44c-4dbc6fc21385_1634x542.png)](https://www.politicalalertengine.com/analytics/market-
overview/impeachment)

If one believes that the market is underpricing this as an inevitability, an
~11% return **(before PredictIt fees of 10% on profits and 5% of total
withdrawal)** can be had. Likewise, if one believes that there is an
asymmetric upside to the probability of Trump not being impeached in year 1,
they’d stand to earn 9x their investment, a sharp rise from the 4x opportunity
when impeachment was an .80/share proposition.

Despite the market for _whether_ President Trump is impeached in his first
term having such short odds, there is still no consensus on _how._ The market
for whether DJT is impeached in 2019 made new highs this week, mirroring the
general first term impeachment, and climbed ~50% to .67/share. Congress has
[indicated](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-
politics/trump-news-live-impeachment-latest-today-
election-2020-twitter-a9235266.html) that they intend to bring articles of
impeachment in the coming week, however, Trump has until a 5pm EST deadline
today to decide whether to mount a defense.  
  
Additionally, the _number_ of articles of impeachment is contentious in the
markets. The favorites in the market for number of articles to be passed by
3/31/2020 are two at .32/share and three at .40/share. Amidst all of the
trader confidence around impeachment, the odds of a senate conviction of Trump
continue trending lower. Those odds now sit at just .13/share, up from a high
of .23/share in October, that the Senate would convict Trump on an article.
