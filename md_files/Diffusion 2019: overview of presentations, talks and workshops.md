# The tone and format of the event was not about crypto theatre, ego and
noise, it was strictly focused on collaboration and building.

What made the event unique was the resolute focus on growing the space
_together_ , in an open exchange of ideas between protocols and teams across
the technology stack from around the globe. The technical, short talks and
workshops focused on building a more equitable, secure, privacy-preserving,
scalable and usable Web3.
