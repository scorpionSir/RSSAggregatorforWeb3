Effective today, we're making two product changes to the dYdX BTC Perpetual
Market:

  * Renaming the contract to BTC-USD
  * Allowing USDT to be deposited and converted to collateral

Under the hood, the only asset that is held as collateral for the BTC-USD
Perpetual will continue to be USDC.

 _* Perpetual Markets on dYdX not available in the United States. No actual
Fiat USD is supported on dYdX._

###  **How it works**

dYdX makes it easy to deposit USDT to the BTC-USD Perpetual. Behind the
scenes, dYdX integrates with Curve to convert the USDT to USDC that is
ultimately held as collateral. Curve is an open decentralized exchange, and
has one of the most liquid USDC-USDT markets, ensuring minimal slippage during
this conversion.

Collateral and quote amounts for the BTC-USD Perpetual are displayed as USD.
USD amounts on dYdX can be withdrawn 1:1 with USDC or can be withdrawn to USDT
by performing an automatic stablecoin conversion through Curve.

###  **Why USDT?**

USDT is by far the largest, most widely held, and most liquid stablecoin
globally. Allowing traders who hold USDT to easily onboard into dYdX's BTC-USD
Perpetual is essential to its user and liquidity growth.

Importantly, users of the BTC-USD Perpetual will not be exposed to price risk
associated with USDT, as it is not held as underlying collateral.

###  **What's next?**

Depositing USDT to the BTC-USD Perpetual is live today. We're continuously
improving the product and welcome your feedback to help us improve dYdX.
