# Redesigning Web3 UX with WalletConnect

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*c6otP9oMHfaUhVx6vqLrpg.png)

There are a lot of discussions around scalability in Ethereum but few around
the experience for users to securely manage and control their keys. To get to
mainstream adoption of a decentralized web there needs to be more work in the
UX side otherwise users will fallback to centralized and custodial services.

However a lot has improved in the past couple months since the price
speculation noise has faded and the community was able to focus on core
issues. More organized discussions and initiatives to create [industry
standards for better UX](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/material-design-for-
dapps/459) have been gaining traction and new protocol standards are moving
faster and debated more effectively.

A couple of months back while struggling to find better Web3 UX alternatives,
I designed a way to enable [Balance Manager](https://manager.balance.io/) to
connect to mobile wallets.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-mwzQYgK6wWpuHdx0KLPWg.jpeg)

We developed a prototype and were so excited with the results that we wanted
to share with everyone so we open-sourced it as
[WalletConnect](https://github.com/WalletConnect).

The vision is to open the world of Dapps that has been enabled by Metamask to
all of the mobile wallets available on iOS and Android without the compromise
of a small screen or a restricted web view. A simple approach that resembles
OAuth that can be implemented by any Dapp or Wallet.

The feedback from the community was amazing and we had external contributions
on Github within the first couple of hours. One month later, a lot of hard
work was put into it by Jin Chung (Balance), Jaynti Kanani (Matic Network),
Arron Hunt (Hart), Jeff Reiner (Contentful) and Witek Randomski (Enjin
Network) which kickstarted the project to a great start.

Last Friday, the Ethereum Community Fund (ECF) in collaboration with Gitcoin
have funded 6 bounties for WalletConnect as part of the Web 3.0 Infrastructure
Fund Pilot Program which were claimed in less than two days.

In May, the Ethereum Foundation awarded WalletConnect with a
[grant](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/05/02/announcing-may-2018-cohort-ef-
grants/) to support its development. So we decided to take WalletConnect a
step further and completely separate it into its own non-profit organization.
I have left Balance to dedicate myself full-time on the WalletConnect
Foundation that will manage and promote the project across all developers in
Ethereum.

But WalletConnect Foundation has the goal to push user experience even
further. We are first focused in developing a set of easy-to-use libraries for
connecting mobile wallets to desktop Dapps but we are not stopping there, we
want to help developers provide better experience for their users to interact
with their Dapp using any wallet.

As first designed by Richard Burton (Balance), we will be developing a
[WalletConnect Widget](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-widget)
for Dapps to easily integrate with Metamask, WalletConnect, Ledger and Trezor.

But we also have plans to expand WalletConnect to communicate between mobile
Dapps and mobile Wallets by using Deep Linking following the great work done
by Viktor Radchenko (Trust) which he [shared back in
May](/@trustwallet/mobile-dapps-with-deep-linking-and-trust-
wallet-6a4712b9b9a4).

Iâ€™m super excited for whatâ€™s coming next for WalletConnect and thankful to
have the early collaboration of amazing teams like Balance, Trust, Enjin,
imToken, MyCrypto and many other individuals. Looking forward to have a lot
more teams join us in this project and build great products for all users in
this space.
