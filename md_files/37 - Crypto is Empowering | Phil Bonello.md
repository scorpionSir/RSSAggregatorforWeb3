37 - Crypto is Empowering | Phil Bonello

Phil Bonelo  
\- Director of Research of Greyscale  
\- Former ikigai asset management  
\- Messari. How crypto powers the individual.

Phil speaks about technology for the people by the people, a central theme of
the Bankless Nation.

Crypto is an empowering technology.

Elliptic curve cryptography provides the maximum level of ownership assurances
over property, a service that the Nation State historically has had monopoly
over.

Cryptocurrency is a subset of cryptograpgy.  
Cryptography powers more thing than just 'crypto'.

Why is it important to have individual-empowering technology?

How does encryption empower the individual? Is this good?

How does cryptography impact global labor markets?

What does an internet-enabled economy produce?

What else can we do with this power?

Join us as we go on this journey!
