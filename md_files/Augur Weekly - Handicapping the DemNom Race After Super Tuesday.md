Wow, what a wild Super Tuesday. We’ve talked a lot here about big swings in
the political betting markets and this week was no exception. After this
week’s showing, the odds for the Democratic Nomination have flipped to firmly
in Biden’s favor.

While Bernie seemed to have the momentum going into Tuesday’s contests, Biden,
keyed by a pre-Tuesday victory in South Carolina, swept in and garnered 10
wins in 14 states:

many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have)

As expected, Biden handily won the southern states, where Sanders’ democratic-
socialist rhetoric is not as well-received. But the real surprise was Joe
coming in to win key battleground contests in states like Texas, Minnesota,
and Massachusetts. PredictIt traders had Bernie as a 1/3 favorite in
Massachusetts going into Super Tuesday, while Biden shares would have earned
holders 20/1, as late as March 2nd. **In Minnesota, A Biden buy on March 1st
would have netted 50/1.**

Bernie Sanders' odds to win the Democratic Nomination have fallen from
57c/share, as recently as March 1st, to their current mark of 14c/share.
Biden, meanwhile, has seen his March 1st odds of 31c/share climb to their
current high of 84c/share.

Will this be the last major swing for the Democratic Nomination? It seems more
likely, as the delegate math is much more clear and as Super Tuesday and the
early primary season have served to narrow the unusually large field to just
Biden and Bernie.

* * *

#### And Then There Were Two

Some of your favorite characters from this election cycle dropped like flies
this week. Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg, and Elizabeth Warren
all announced the suspension of their campaigns. All of these candidates, save
Warren, immediately endorsed Joe Biden; who will presumably pick up their
delegates at the convention.

It was a fun run with this crowded primary cast that produced some interesting
debate moments, but we are down to the final matchup for the Democratic
Nomination.

* * *

#### Upcoming Primaries

While Super Tuesday served to knock off a large initial chunk of delegate
allocation, it is far from the end of the primary season. There are 3,979
pledged delegates in the Democratic contest, and 1,499 will have been allotted
after Super Tuesday, with 2,480 remaining.

Biden’s ~80 delegate lead is not insurmountable, Sanders only needs to win a
little over 51 percent of remaining pledged delegates to pass Biden. The
problem is that the calendar suggests Sanders is in danger of falling
hopelessly behind in the next few weeks.  
  
This coming Tuesday marks another large delegate day, as 6 states hold their
contests:

many-delegates-do-the-2020-presidential-democratic-candidates-have)

 **Currently, PredictIt has the following prices for these states:**

Idaho: _Bernie_ **55c** | _Biden_ **46c**  
Michigan: _Bernie_ **16c** | _Biden_ **86c**  
Mississippi: _Bernie_ **2c** | _Biden_ **99c**  
Missouri: _Bernie_ **10c** | _Biden_ **91c**  
North Dakota: _Bernie_ **36c** | _Biden_ **66c**  
Washington: _Bernie_ **63c** | _Biden_ **38c**

If these results held true, Biden would pick up another 4 states, furthering
his delegate lead. On two more consecutive Tuesdays, March 17th and 24th,
another five states will convene. After March 24th, only 36% of delegates will
be left for grabs.

Frankly, Sanders needs some surprise victories in the next few weeks to keep
himself within striking distance.

Despite the nominal lead, it will still take Biden quite the uphill battle to
actually clinch the nomination (assuming Bernie sticks around). He’ll need to
win delegates at a ~60% pace to clinch by May, and ~55% to clinch by June.

* * *

#### Contested Convention Watch

It was a fun narrative while it lasted, but alas, along with Bernie’s odds of
winning the nomination, the odds of a contested convention have fallen
precipitously (from 60c/share to 13c/share) after Super Tuesday’s results.

Had it seemed that Bernie would have a leading delegate share by convention
time, I suspect you would have seen the odds for this market continue to trend
higher

Alas, it seems the DNC has saved itself from the PR nightmare of hosting a
live coup of Bernie Sanders.
