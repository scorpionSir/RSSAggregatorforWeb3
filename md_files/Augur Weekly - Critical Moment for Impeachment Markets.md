> #### `Political Betting Roundup`

This week, the impeachment hearings for President Donald Trump’s inquiries
into Joe Biden’s son in Ukraine, and the alleged quid-pro-quo, brings markets
affected by its result into focus. Wednesday featured testimonies from William
B. Taylor Jr., acting ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant
secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. No smoking gun emerged
from these initial testimonies, and the betting markets remained relatively
unchanged; **leaving bettors hoping to profit from a volatile soundbite
wanting**. Today features further testimony from former ambassador to Ukraine,
Marie L. Yovanovitch.

As you can see in the above chart from [Jim Bianco
Research](https://www.biancoresearch.com/visitor-home/), the PredictIt odds
for Congress passing an article of impeachment have been steadily trending
upwards since the initial spike when Nancy Pelosi announced her inquiry
(Currently 0.77/share). While odds are quite short, representing the market’s
belief that the passing of at least one article of impeachment is inevitable,
**a dissenting thesis can earn ~3.3x on their money if correct.**

[![Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefffd2a9-288f-4e19-8b76-bdedf7fff555_2400x1800.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1194637754623070208)

Although the odds of impeachment are quite short, the odds of a Senate
conviction remain long in contrast. Given GOP control of the senate, the
betting public believes that would be a long shot (currently 0.17/share). Like
the market on impeachment, a contrarian here stands to earn a substantial
return, ~5.9x, for a correct prediction.

Elsewhere in political betting news, the **markets for the Democratic
nomination continue their week-over-week volatility**. After making an initial
splash with his [announcement](https://augur.substack.com/p/augur-weekly-
m_bloomberg-has-entered), Mike Bloomberg’s odds have fallen back to earth from
0.13/share to 0.06; while his theoretical competition for the moderate voting
base, Pete Buttigieg (0.19/share) and Joe Biden (0.23/share), seemed to have
regained their lost footing. What’s more, not only did this recovery put
distance between Buttigieg/Biden and Bloomberg, but it also added some
separation from Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang, the owners of the fourth and
fifth-best odds at 14c and 9c, respectively.

 **The most notable story in the Democratic nomination market, however, is
Elizabeth Warren’s continued fall from bettors’ grace.**

Warren’s early October odds painted her favorite status as a foregone
conclusion. However, as we’ve noted here, sentiment this far out tends to be
fickle. What’s also interesting to note, at this point, is the dichotomy
between polls and markets. While a recent
[post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/11/10/when-prediction-
markets-fail/) (bonus: fun prediction market math discussion in the comment
section, if that’s your thing) paints markets as being driven by poll
sentiment, the divergence captured below suggests otherwise:

David’s right, Sportsbooks are certainly going to have disadvantageous odds
and pricing relative to prediction markets. Couple that with the inability to
exchange your position and it becomes clear that buying a ticket is the
suboptimal route.

As a reminder, come Q1 2020,  **[Augur](https://www.augur.net/) will be the
only platform for political betting with no limits, the lowest fees, and
unbeatable odds.**
