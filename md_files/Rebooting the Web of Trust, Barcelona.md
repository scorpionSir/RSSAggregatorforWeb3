## Rebooting the Web of Trust, Barcelona

By [Philip Sheldrake](/blog/author/philip-sheldrake/)

AKASHA](https://beta.akasha.world/#/0x872f8817ecf68ec4a5f940375a7900f9814da047/0xbce82338635c1b15b3b2a4ce9f8c87b09f0158911d037138d456e5ee90821f1f)

In her book, [_A Question of Trust_](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901340118),
Onora O’Neill writes:

> Each of us and every profession and every institution needs trust. We need
> it because we have to be able to rely on others acting as they say that they
> will, and because we need others to accept that we will act as we say we
> will. The sociologist Niklas Luhmann was right that "A complete absence of
> trust would prevent [one] even getting up in the morning."

The Digital Life Collective outlines why introducing technology complicates
this natural, social mechanism, concluding:

> We know that if we cannot trust our tech it's increasingly difficult to
> trust ourselves. And if we cannot trust ourselves, we cannot trust each
> other.

It doesn't really get more fundamental than that in underlining the imperative
for a 'web of trust'.

I'm in Barcelona this weekend for the 8th [_Rebooting the Web of
Trust_](https://www.weboftrust.info/) meetup. If you're not familiar with the
phrase 'web of trust', it was coined in the early 90s by Phil Zimmerman,
creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software.

While it originally related to a specific technical execution, the term is
invoked more generally today to describe the prospect of a private and secure
peer-to-peer / person-to-person / agent-to-agent network, i.e. one that does
not require a centralized intermediating service. And needless to say, the
aspiration is to make it scalable and a beautiful user experience to drive
mass adoption, requirements that haven't yet been achieved — hence the need
for a rebooting.

The perfect (if that's the right word) dystopian example [popped up in the
news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/china-
bans-23m-discredited-citizens-from-buying-travel-tickets-social-credit-
system?CMP=share_btn_tw) during proceedings on Friday:

> China has blocked millions of “discredited” travellers from buying plane or
> train tickets as part of the country’s controversial “social credit” system
> aimed at improving the behaviour of citizens.

If we get this wrong, we will deliver accidentally, by emergence, the very
social engineering developed deliberately in China. We must be sensitive to
the [evil potential of reputation
systems](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/23/interpersonal-data-3-of-3).

### Decentralized Identifiers

A good part of this community's work is dedicated to [Decentralized
Identifiers](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-
and-advance-readings/did-primer.md) (DIDs):

> … a new type of globally unique identifier. … the core component of an
> entirely new layer of decentralized digital identity.
>
> … DID infrastructure can be thought of as a global _key-value database_ in
> which the database is all DID-compatible blockchains, distributed ledgers,
> or decentralized networks. In this virtual database, the key is a DID, and
> the value is a DID document [that describes] the public keys, authentication
> protocols, and service endpoints necessary to bootstrap cryptographically-
> verifiable interactions with the identified identity.

DIDs are integral to the engineering needed in pursuit of the AKASHA
Foundation's purpose — nurturing projects helping individuals unlock their
potential through open systems that expand our collective minds at local,
regional, and global scales. Such systems will necessarily be decentralized,
secure, and private, and must also facilitate the meaningful aggregation of
data for real-time and verifiable sense-making by the participants involved
and those effected.

Expect to hear more on this front in the not too distant :-)
