# Announcing $2.4 Million Seed Round

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*au3tkgGlgZfl-SJBdkWErA.png)

[InstaDApp](https://instadapp.io) is a DeFi portal that aggregates the major
protocols using a smart wallet layer and bridge contracts, making it easy for
users to make the best decisions about assets and execute previously complex
transactions seamlessly.

As a testament to the deep need to simplify DeFi, the launch of our protocol
bridge saw explosive growth, growing the value locked in our smart contracts
by 9 times, from $4M to over $35M. We are now #3 in total value locked after
MakerDAO and Compound.

While other DApps are just interfaces for DeFi protocols, we have created a
mediator smart wallet layer between the user interface and protocols, which
greatly simplifies the effort and cost of performing complex financial
transactions, including lend/borrow, leverage and switch debt positions.

## Investors And Advisors

To help us continue our quest to make DeFi accessible to the masses, we have
raised a seed round of $2.4M from a network of strategic investors, including
Pantera Capital, Naval Ravikant, Balaji Srinivasan, Coinbase Ventures, IDEO
Colab, Robot Ventures (Robert Leshner of Compound Finance), Loi Luu (Kyber
Network), amongst many others.

> We are impressed by InstaDapp’s laser focus on aggregating and simplifying
> DeFi and their growth has been a testament to their ability to execute
> successfully. InstaDapp stands out from everything else we have seen in the
> space so far. We believe they’re the right team to push the future of DeFi
> forward and help the next wave of users to onboard to the open financial
> ecosystem. — Paul Veradittakit, Pantera.

In addition, we are delighted to welcome Edward Moncada, CEO of Blockfolio and
Ming Ng, who collaborates closely with prominent projects including Handshake,
Kyber, and Blockfolio, to our advisory board.

## Our Journey To Instadapp

> InstaDapp is a very talented team out of India looking to make decentralized
> finance more accessible. — Balaji Srinivasan, former CTO of Coinbase

This raise marks a key milestone in our journey in building and evangelizing
fintech. Ever since we were in our teenage years, we have started
participating in the Indian stock market and discussing finance on blogs and
forums like Quora, generating millions of hits to date. We then went on to
building software to simplify stock market investing and investing in crypto.

Eventually, we dropped out of school to become full-on “native defi”. A big
reason was we realized that the traditional finance systems we were studying
in school were slow to innovate, extremely restrictive, tightly controlled by
financial giants, and bound by geographical constraints.

> With DeFi though, we realized that _we can not only participate, but also
> able to innovate globally from day one_.

Ever since these realizations, we began shifting our efforts from traditional
fintech and markets into the open world of decentralized finance. After
participating and winning EthIndia one year ago, we received a grant from
Kyber Network to start work on what will become Instadapp today.

Now 21 (Sowmay) and 19 (Samyak), we have been living and breathing crypto and
DeFi for almost our entire formative lives, including accepting grants, doing
payrolls and financing our expenses from ETH backed collateralized loans. We
are grateful for the opportunity to build more innovative technology and
evangelizing DeFi to bring the same benefits we experienced to the wider
world.

## Simplifying Complex DeFi Transactions

> Instadapp is focused on becoming the portal to open finance, and is
> innovating in an area where most teams are stagnant — delivering an
> exceptional user experience.— Robert Leshner, Compound

Prior to Instadapp, most of these actions would have needed multiple
transactions across different protocols, requiring users to understand the
deeper financial and technical workings of each of them. With our smart wallet
layer and bridge contracts, these complex operations become one single, simple
transaction.

The best example is our protocol bridge between Compound and Maker, which
allows users to switch debt positions between the two protocols in a single
step, without the need to tediously monitor interest rates across these
markets, perform expensive capital redeployments, and perform multiple complex
transactions.

As the number of protocols, assets, and derivatives explode in number, the
need for key innovations like these to optimize and make the full use of DeFi
becomes crucial.

## Bringing DeFi to the masses.

> The Instadapp team is the best demonstration of how open and innovative this
> public blockchain space can be. We were fortunate to be able to work and
> support the team in the early days. It’s been a pure joy to see how they
> keep inventing and releasing new products, which is very rare in this space.
> I look forward to more interesting initiatives from them. — Loi Luu, Kyber
> Network

DeFi is extremely promising and could potentially bring on a sea change in how
the masses manage their financial assets. However, the infrastructure today is
lacking, ranging from unscalable blockchains and a lack of common standards.
The open nature of DeFi also means that anyone can create new and improved
systems.

On top of needing to understanding finance, one will also need to be very
familiar with the deep technical workings, as well as keep track of all the
evolving protocols and their different markets. This makes accessibility to
DeFi limited to only a very small % of people, even those relatively familiar
with crypto.

So far, we have been successful at abstracting away a number of these hurdles
with our combination of intuitive user interfaces, smart wallet layer and
bridge contracts, but we are very, very early in this journey. Along with our
investors and community, we look forward to building the next generation of
systems that will allow the masses to make the most of their decentralized
assets.
