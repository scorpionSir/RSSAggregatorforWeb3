###  Pascal's scams

Beware of what I call Pascal's scams: movements or belief systems that ask you
to hope for or worry about very improbable outcomes that could have very large
positive or negative consequences. (The name comes of course from the
infinite-reward Wager proposed by Pascal: these days the large-but-finite
versions are far more pernicious).  Naive expected value reasoning implies
that they are worth the effort: if the odds are 1 in 1,000 that I could win $1
billion, and I am risk and time neutral, then I should expend up to nearly $1
million dollars worth of effort to gain this boon. The problems with these
beliefs tend to be at least threefold, all stemming from the general
uncertainty, i.e. the poor information or lack of information, from which we
abstracted the low probability estimate in the first place: because in the
messy real world the low probability estimate is almost always due to low or
poor evidence rather than being a lottery with well-defined odds:  
  
(1) there is usually no feasible way to distinguish between the very
improbable (say, 1 in 1,000) and the extremely improbable (e.g., one in a
billion). Poor evidence leads to what[ James
Franklin](http://lpr.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/2/159.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=ny8A8TF7Lp8kezF)
calls "low-weight probabilities", which lack robustness to new evidence. When
the evidence is poor, and thus robustness of probabilities is lacking, then it
is likely that "a small amount of further evidence would substantially change
the probability. "  This new evidence is as likely to decrease the probability
by a factor of X as increase it by a factor of X, and the poorer the original
evidence, the greater X is.  (Indeed, given the nature of human imagination
and bias, it is more likely to decrease it, for reasons described below).  
  
(2) the uncertainties about the diversity and magnitudes of possible
consequences, not just their probabilities, are also likely to be extremely
high. Indeed, due to the overall poor information, it's easy to overlook
negative consequences and recognize only positive ones, or vice-versa. The
very acts you take to make it into utopia or avoid dystopia could easily send
you to dystopia or make the dystopia worse.  
  
(3) The "unknown unknown" nature of the most uncertainty leads to
unfalsifiablity: proponents of the proposition can't propose a clear
experiment that would greatly lower the probability or magnitude of
consequences of their proposition: or at least, such an experiment would be
far too expensive to actually be run, or cannot be conducted until after the
time which the believers have already decided that the long-odds bet is
rational. So not only is there poor information in a Pascal scam, but in the
more pernicious beliefs there is little ability to improve the information.  
  
The biggest problem with these schemes is that, the closer to infinitesimal
probability, and thus usually to infinitesimal quality or quantity of
evidence, one gets, the closer to infinity the possible extreme-consequence
schemes one can dream up,  Once some enterprising memetic innovator dreams up
a Pascal's scam, the probabilities or consequences of these possible futures
can be greatly exaggerated yet still seem plausible. "Yes, but _what if_?" the
carrier of such a mind-virus incessantly demands.  Furthermore, since more
than a few disasters are indeed low probability events (e.g. 9/11), the
plausibility and importance of dealing with such risks seems to grow in
importance after they occur -- the occurrence of one improbable disaster leads
to paranoia about a large number of others, and similarly for fortuitous
windfalls and hopes. Humanity can dream up a near-infinity of Pascal's scams,
or spend a near-infinity of time fruitlessly worrying about them or hoping for
them. There are however far better ways to spend one's time -- for example in
thinking about what has actually happened in the real world, rather than the
vast number of things that might happen in the future but quite probably
won't, or will likely cause consequences very differently than you expect.  
  
So how should we approach low probability hypotheses with potential high value
(negative or positive) outcomes?  Franklin et. al.
[suggest](http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/advocacydivdist.pdf) that "[t]he
strongly quantitative style of education in statistics, valuable as it is, can
lead to a neglect of the more qualitative, logical, legal and causal
perspectives needed to understand data intelligently. That is especially so in
extreme risk analysis, where there is a lack of large data sets to ground
solidly quantitative conclusions, and correspondingly a need to supplement the
data with outside information and with argument on individual data points."  
  
On the above quoted points I agree with Franklin, and add a more blunt
suggestion: stop throwing around long odds and dreaming of big consequences as
if you are onto something profound.  If you can't gather the information
needed to reduce the uncertainties, and if you can't suggest experiments to
make the hope or worry falsifiable, stop nightmaring or daydreaming already.
Also, shut up and stop trying to convince the rest of us to join you in
wasting our time hoping or worrying about these fantasies.  Try spending more
time learning about what has actually happened in the real world.  That study,
too, has its uncertainties, but they are up to infinitely smaller.

Brian H, you'll often save many people from needless nightmaring or
daydreaming if you are able to give good reasons about why it's BS.  
  
In response to the two Anonymi, I wasn't going to name names, but the rapture
or doom of "the Singularity", "SkyNet", "the Matrix", and similar robot
apocalypse scenarios, does seem to fit the bill, especially regarding the
inability of their proponents to design experiments that would give us
information about these ideas that would greatly reduce uncertainties about
them. Instead, they go straight to supposed solutions (per above, as likely to
lead closer to dystopia as to closer to utopia, since the uncertainties about
the underlying causes are so high, falsely precise rhetoric notwithstanding).  
  
I describe the economic and computational efficiency reasons why the odds of
either very useful or very dangerous "general AI" are very long

the original post and some of my comments below it.

Per Hanson's donation: a huge uncertainty, i.e. point (1) above, with the
Brain Preservation Technology Prize is the supposed strong relationship
between "with such fidelity that the structure of every neuronal process and
every synaptic connection remains intact and traceable using today's electron
microscopic (EM) imaging techniques" (a mistake right there, since these
techniques image static structure, they don't trace processes), and the goal
that one day subjects undergoing some such treatment will "live again." It's
quite possible that the presumably requisite consciousness and memories for
"liv[ing] again" require molecular or other kinds of structures different from
those being preserved here.  
  
Furthermore, preserving information about a molecular structure does _not_
automatically, or perhaps even probably in the case of sophisticated
assemblages of biomolecules, lead to the ability to recreate that structure in
sufficient detail. It's possible that the chemical routes for doing so may
prove infeasible (i.e. too expensive for any feasible technology).  
  
What's more, per point (2), we don't know whether such capabilities even if
they worked would lead to utopia or dystopia for the experimental subjects
preserving their brains in hopes of future reanimation. The superhuman brain
scientists of the future mainly might well look on me, even while "liv[ing]
again", the way today's scientists treat their static brain slices: as a
specimin to be studied. Nobody real knows whether these experimental subjects
will wake up in a high-tech paradise or as hopelessly inferior subjects in a
gruesome experiment they can't control.  
  
There are probably many other sources of uncertainty that I haven't considered
yet, and many they haven't considered yet either.  
  
On point (3) I give them credit since they are trying experiments to reduce
some of the uncertainties involved, even if much uncertainty would remain
after the prize for preserving certain structures has been won. And the
experiments don't seem very expensive. So, while not donating myself, I say
let them have at it.

nick, WRT plastination:  
My understanding is that the ability to cold boot humans without loss of
function (people resuscitated after cessation of electrical activity in the
brain) implies that the structure is what is important.

@Nick Szabo  
  
Eliezer Yudkowsky does actually believe that a negative technological
singularity due to unfriendly artificial general intelligence is not a low
probability event. Here are two quotes:  
  
 _" I don't think the odds of us being wiped out by badly done AI are small. I
think they're easily larger than 10%. And if you can carry a qualitative
argument that the probability is under, say, 1%, then that means AI is
probably the wrong use of marginal resources - not because global warming is
more important, of course, but because other ignored existential risks like
nanotech would be more important. I am not trying to play burden-of-proof
tennis. If the chances are under 1%, that's low enough, we'll drop the AI
business from consideration until everything more realistic has been handled.
We could try to carry the argument otherwise, but I do quite agree that it
would be a nitwit thing to do in real life, like trying to shut down the Large
Hadron Collider."_  
  
http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/what-to-do/#comment-5546  
  
 _" I keep telling SIAI people to never reply to "AI risks are small" with
"but a small probability is still worth addressing". Reason 2: It sounds like
an attempt to shut down debate over probability. Reason 3: It sounds like the
sort of thing people are more likely to say when defending a weak argument
than a strong one. Listeners may instinctively recognize that as well.  
  
Existential risks from AI are not under 5%. If anyone claims they are, that
is, in emotional practice, an instant-win knockdown argument unless countered;
it should be countered directly and aggressively, not weakly deflected."_  
  
The same seem to be true for cryonics, if you Google "We Agree: Get Froze" you
can find the following quote by Robin Hanson:  
  
 _" So if whole brain emulation is ever achieved, and if freezing doesn't
destroy info needed for an em scan, ifs we think more likely than not, future
folks could make an em out of your frozen brain."_

Robin on cryonics:  
  
"Your chance of being usefully revived in 2090 as an em is roughly the product
of these ten conditional probability terms. Ten 90% terms gives a total chance
of ~1/3. Ten 80% terms gives a total chance of ~10%, except step 4 might be a
50% chance, for a total chance of ~6%, which seems about right to me."

I don't know if you read lesswrong but [some of
them](http://lesswrong.com/lw/dng/link_nick_szabo_beware_pascals_scams/) seem
to use the fact that the Singularity Institute does believe that it is _not_
improbable (>1%) that we'll have to face AI risks as an argumentative defeat.  
  
Which doesn't really undermine your argument in my opinion. Since as far as I
understand, you 1.) do not believe that a negative singularity is probable 2.)
don't think that the burden of proof is on you to show that it isn't probable
3.) believe that the margin of error of any argument to the contrary is large
enough to constitute a case of Pascal's mugging, since claims by the mugger
that the threat is probable are simply part of the scenarios that you reject.  
  
I have [written down some of my on

Alexander: that's largely correct. Regarding your point (2), I do think it's
useful for counter-arguments to exist to make at least a plausible case for
the low probability of the general category of the futuristic scenario, as I
have regarding specialized vs. general AI. One is under no obligation at all
to address their specific claims, much less their specific solutions, as there
are a near-infinity of such possible claims and solutions.  
  
This is the first time I've heard the phrase "Pascal's mugging", so I just
Googled it and saw Yudkowsky's article -- a similar idea to the Pascal scam to
be sure, but my focus is on the underlying poor quality of evidence for the
claim, in situations that don't need to be anywhere close to as theoretical or
extreme as the idea that we are living in a simulation. There are a near-
infinity of plausible-sounding but poorly evidenced claims about the future
one can make in and about our own physical universe, so that such claims
should be nearly infinitely discounted.  
  
The Pascal's mugger, who implicitly states that he is 100% certain, is a good
example of why numerical probability estimates in these situations are false
precision and arguments from authority, not good evidence. Some people who
call themselves Bayesians sometimes or even often tend to confuse probability
estimates with actual evidence, obsessing with the estimates and ignoring the
actual evidence (or lack thereof).

Also, "Pascal's mugger" strongly suggests some intent to deceive, whereas no
such intent is required for a Pascal scam. (Even "scam" may thus be often less
accurate terminology than, say, "delusion", or in non-obsessive and non-
evangelizing cases just "mistake").

nazgulnarsil, that structure could well be molecular, not just the connectome
(synapses plus their connections). That possibility is plausible enough that
the burden of proof is on those making such otherwise meaningless numerical
probability estimates to prove otherwise, and thus justify the attention,
money, or other resources they seek.

Here's a comment I made to people responding to (at least a lossy summary of)
this post on Less Wrong:  
  
The asteroid threat is a good example of a low-probability disaster that is
probably not a Pascal scam. On point (1) it is fairly lottery-like, insofar as
asteroid orbits are relatively predictable -- the unknowns are primarily
"known unknowns", being deviations from very simple functions -- so it's
possible to compute odds from actual data, rather than merely guessing them
from a morass of "unknown unknowns". It passes test (2) as we have good ways
to simulate with reasonable accuracy and (at some expense, only if needed)
actually test solutions. And best of all it passes test (3) -- experiments or
observations can be done to improve our information about those odds. Most of
the funding has, quite properly, gone to those empirical observations, not
towards speculating about solutions before the problem has been well
characterized.  
  
Alas, most alleged futuristic threats and hopes don't fall into such a clean
category: the evidence is hopelessly equivocal (even if declared with a false
certainty) or missing, and those advocating that our attention and other
resources be devoted to them usually fail to propose experiments or
observations that would imrove that evidence and thus reduce our uncertainty
to levels that would distinguish them from the near-infinity of plausible
disaster scenarios we could imagine. (Even with just the robot apocalypse,
there are a near-infinity of ways one can plausibly imagine it playing out).

_Some people who call themselves Bayesians sometimes or even often tend to
confuse probability estimates with actual evidence, obsessing with the
estimates and ignoring the actual evidence (or lack thereof)._  
  
Which is basically the gist of most disagreement between the kind of people
associated with the Singularity Institute and who those people call
"traditional rationalists".  
  
The current state of the art formalization of technical rationality does
indicate that a rational decision maker should rely less on empirical evidence
than "traditional rationalists"/scientists tend to do and rather take logical
implications much more seriously.  
  
My personal disagreement with them is mainly that I go a step further in
rejecting the extent to which logical implications bear on decision making.
Just as them I wouldn't give money to a Pascal's mugger. But I consider
certain attitudes towards AI risks and existential risks to be a case of
Pascal's mugging. Which they don't.  
  
As far as I can tell, the whole sequence of posts that Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote
on the many world interpretation of quantum mechanics was meant to convey what
you are rejecting, namely that probabilistic beliefs should be taken more
seriously. And further that the implied invisible, that which logically
follows from any given empirical evidence, shouldn't be discounted completely.  
  
I might be wrong here as I am not too familiar with the sequences.  
  
I don't disagree with them, except that I think the associated model
uncertainty is doomed to be too drastic to take any given conclusions too
seriously. More [here](http://kruel.co/2012/06/25/rationality-implications/).  
  
In short (excerpt of my post):  
  
You might argue that I would endorse position 12 [1] if NASA told me that
there was a 20% chance of an extinction sized asteroid hitting Earth and that
they need money to deflect it. I would indeed. But that seems like a
completely different scenario to me.  
  
I would have to be able to assign more than a 80% probability to AI being an
_existential_ risk to endorse that position. I would further have to be
_highly_ confident that we will have to face that risk _within this century_
and that the model uncertainty associated with my estimates is _low_.  
  
That intuition does stem from the fact that any estimates regarding AI risks
are _very_ likely to be wrong, whereas in the example case of an asteroid
collision one could be _much_ more confident in the 20% estimate. As the
latter is based on _empirical evidence_ while the former is inference based
and therefore much more **error prone**.  
  
I don't think that the evidence allows anyone to take position 12, or even 11,
and be even slightly confident about it.  
  
I am also highly skeptical about using the expected value of a galactic
civilization to claim otherwise. Because that reasoning will ultimately make
you privilege unlikely high-utility outcomes over much more probable theories
that are based on empirical evidence.  
  
[1] Position 12: _This is crunch time. This is crunch time for the entire
human species. And it 's crunch time not just for us, it's crunch time for the
intergalactic civilization whose existence depends on us. Everyone should
contribute all but their minimal living expenses in support of the issue._

With asteroid detection, there is a mechanism to determine where we have
established a dangerous asteroid isn't. We can asymptotically approach 100%
certainty that there is no dangerous asteroid within any given volume. You
could easily administer a $10bn bounty, payable to the first person or group
who identifies an asteroid of some determined size that will collide with
Earth, and a $1tn bounty to the group that manages to change the trajectory.
Those bounties are clearly worthwhile to issue, even at those absurd amounts.
The low chance of payoff might result in few people trying to earn them, but
that's a different issue.  
  
Right now the SI has not adequately defined Friendly AI to the point where
they could offer a prize for solving the problem. If they can't offer a
definition robust enough for a neutral party to resolve the dispute which will
occur when somebody claims to have solved the AI problem but the SI disagrees,
then they haven't defined the problem well enough to post a prize.

One correction regarding my last comment. Position 12 is not a verbatim quote
by Eliezer Yudkowsky. Here is what he actually wrote:  
  
 _[ 因 I would be asking for more people to make as much money as possible if
they're the sorts of people who can make a lot of money and can donate a
substantial amount fraction, never mind all the minimal living expenses, to
the Singularity Institute.  
  
This is crunch time. This is crunch time for the entire human species. [因 and
it's crunch time not just for us, it's crunch time for the intergalactic
civilization whose existence depends on us. I think that if you're actually
just going to sort of confront it, rationally, full-on, then you can't really
justify trading off any part of that intergalactic civilization for any
intrinsic thing that you could get nowadays [因  
  
[因 having seen that intergalactic civilization depends on us, in one sense,
all you can really do is try not to think about that, and in another sense
though, if you spend your whole life creating art to inspire people to fight
global warming, you're taking that 'forgetting about intergalactic
civilization' thing much too far."_

If you wonder what AI researchers think, some time ago I conducted a Q&A style
interview series with a bunch of people, all except one actual AI researchers:  
  
[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Interview_series_on_risks_from_AI](Interview%20series%20on%20risks%20from%20AI)  
  
@Nick Szabo  
  
I would love you to answer the questions as well :-)  
  
1.) Assuming beneficial political and economic development and that no global
catastrophe halts progress, by what year would you assign a 10%/50%/90% chance
of the development of artificial intelligence that is roughly as good as
humans (or better, perhaps unevenly) at science, mathematics, engineering and
programming?  
  
2.) Once we build AI that is roughly as good as humans (or better, perhaps
unevenly) at science, mathematics, engineering and programming, how much more
difficult will it be for humans and/or AIs to build an AI which is
substantially better at those activities than humans?  
  
3.) Do you ever expect artificial intelligence to overwhelmingly outperform
humans at typical academic research, in the way that they may soon
overwhelmingly outperform humans at trivia contests, or do you expect that
humans will always play an important role in scientific progress?  
  
4.) What probability do you assign to the possibility of an AI with initially
roughly professional human-level competence (or better, perhaps unevenly) at
general reasoning (including science, mathematics, engineering and
programming) to self-modify its way up to vastly superhuman capabilities
within a matter of hours/days/< 5 years?  
  
5.) How important is it to research risks associated with artificial
intelligence that is good enough at general reasoning (including science,
mathematics, engineering and programming) to be capable of radical self-
modification, before attempting to build one?  
  
6.) What probability do you assign to the possibility of human extinction
within 100 years as a result of AI capable of self-modification (that is not
provably non-dangerous, if that is even possible)? P(human extinction by AI |
AI capable of self-modification and not provably non-dangerous is created)

Regarding the questions of my previous comment and the probability estimates
they ask for. I agree with you that such estimates can be very misleading. I
don't expect numerical estimates. I'd just be curious about your general
opinion with respect to those questions.  
  
It is actually one of the topics I am most confused about, namely the pros and
cons of making up numerical probability estimates.  
  
I do believe that using Bayes' rule when faced with data from empirical
experiments, or goats behind doors in a gameshow, is the way to go.  
  
But I fear that using formal methods to evaluate informal evidence might lend
your beliefs an improper veneer of respectability and in turn make them appear
to be more trustworthy than your intuition. For example, using formal methods
to evaluate something like AI risks might cause dramatic overconfidence.  
  
Bayes' rule only tells us by how much we should increase our credence given
certain input. But given most everyday life circumstances the input is often
conditioned and evaluated by our intuition. Which means that using Bayes' rule
to update on evidence does emotionally push the use of intuition onto a lower
level. In other words, using Bayes' rule to update on evidence that is vague
(the conclusions being highly error prone), and given probabilities that are
being filled in by intuition, might simply disguise the fact that you are
still using your intuition after all, while making you believe that you are
not.  
  
Even worse, using formal methods on informal evidence might introduce
additional error sources.

According to Eliezer &co, who have an obvious monetary motivation, and who do
not promote logical implications, but instead something that on surface sounds
vaguely reasonable but is about as effective as truth finding method as
medieval scholasticism.  
  
You do not have reason to describe it as state of the art. There has been no
great success attributable to informal 'formalizations' you refer to.  
  
While the logical implications certainly have to be followed, the scholastic
implications as conjectured by Eliezer, certainly should not.  
  
Furthermore, from visiting lesswrong you may have massively skewed view on the
decision making under uncertainty. There is a method that does not rely on
made up priors. If I commit to believe in a hypothesis if it passes a test
that has one in a million chance of a false positive, i have at most one in a
million chance of believing in an invalid hypothesis; after considering the
number of hypotheses you deal with, the cost of invalid belief, and the cost
of tests, an appropriate testing strategy can be devised with a well defined
worst-case performance, without ever making up a prior out of thin air.  
  
The 'technical rationality' as described on lesswrong is as much worthy of
'state of the art' title as Hubbard's dianetics or Keith Raniere's NXIVM.

What are you calling "state of the art" ? The informal "formalizations"
originating from the same Eliezer Yudkowsky? What he is relying on has nothing
to do with logic and as a truth finding method ranks some place near medieval
scholasticism. Half the arguments rely on 'look theres this possible
consequence and we can't imagine other possibilities so it must be true', and
the other half replackages the general difficulty of building and motivating
AI as the difficulty of making survivable AI.

Alexander:  
  
And you learnt of those from where?  
  
I'm using Bayes theorem in my work. Can't say about Solomonoff induction, it
being non-computable.  
  
The Bayes theorem, combined with Solomonoff induction and halting
problem/undecidability, is if anything, a proof that you can not find a
probability of theory being true.  
  
Instead, alternative methods have to be used when no prior is available.  
  
For instance, if I commit to believe that a hypothesis is true if an
experiment with one in a billion false positive rate has confirmed that the
hypothesis is true, then the probability of me ending up with a belief in this
false hypothesis is at most one in a billion. Given the cost of experiments
and the costs of invalid beliefs of either kind, as well as the number of
hypotheses being tested, the optimal standard for evidence (under worst-case
assumptions) can be chosen, all without EVER pulling a number out of your ass
and calling it a probability. This comes complete with resistance to various
forms of pascal's wager, especially given that in the event that you are being
offered a wager, there is significant probability of needing the money in the
future for some other wager that would come with a proof.

Another result of what I once dubbed "Rapture of the Future" is that makes it
hard to work on all that boring, short-term, intense stuff....like debugging a
chip, or installing a new ion implant machine, that sort of boring grunge.  
  
I'm being facetious. But I saw it a bunch of times back 20 years ago when a
lot of the cool new stuff was first getting wide exposure on the then-emerging
mailing lists. (Extropians, Cryonics-l, Cyberia-l, Cypherpunks...).  
  
A bunch of folks were doing menial work at bookstores (one worked at the
libertarian bookstore in SF, another was an unemployed philosopher). It was a
lot easier to think about what "rules for Jupiter-sized brains" should be than
to learn, as one of your blog commenters put it, to learn what a partial
derivative is and how to use it.)  
  
I can recall one of the leader philosophers of nanotechnology--no, neither
Drexler nor Merkle--saying at a nanotech discussion in 1992-3 that "This
entire valley (Silicon) will be gone in 20 years!"  
  
Whoops.  
  
But the effect of the intoxication of the Rapture of the Future, either the
positive or the negate sides of what Nick is calling Pascal's scams, can be
debilitating.  
  
Frankly, I'm pretty glad that I "came up" during an era where so much tweeting
and blogging and e-mailing and "bottle rockets being fired off" were not
distracting me. To learn what I needed to learn to later do something useful
(and financially rewarding) I had to buckle down and work. And at my job, the
focus was on fairly short-term milestones, not grand visions of the future.  
  
Believe me, one of my boss's boss's bosses was Gordon Moore. And I can say he
was no blue sky dreamer. And his observation had a lot more to do with saying
"This is what we've seen in the last 5-6 years," along with some solid
comments on the obvious "t-shirt printing" side of things. By this I mean that
photolithography is a lot like silk-screening a t-shirt, and a lot of the jump
from 100 transistors per die (chip) to 10,000 to a million, etc. had to do
with precision optics, precision stepper motors....essentially printing images
at higher and higher resolutions. Some things came from device physics (I
worked on some of this), some things came from better CAD tools, but most of
"Moore's Law" comes from photolithography. Even today, with the newest "step
and repeat" systems costing $25 million EACH. Those are some expensive
cameras!  
  
Not much room for Rapture-a-tarians in this environment.  
  
And a problem with a lot of these "planning" groups (the Usual Suspects) is
that too many of the members want to be the Big Thinkers and authors of the
policy papers.

Tim, great comments on the actual history of computing -- far better
information there than in a library full of speculations about the future. So
it turns out that the future of computing depended much more on t-shirt
printing tech than on self-replicating diamondoid nanobots. Put that into your
Bayesian pipes and puff out some numbers. :-)  
  
Alexander, for most of your questions, even putting an answer into words, much
less numbers, would be an exercise in false precision. I don't know what the
"t-shirt printing" technology of the future will be (of course the futurists
who pretend to know such things don't know either, so I'm in good company).
Generally speaking, though, most of those things are already partially
happening now, but won't happen anywhere close to completely before culture
has radically changed in a myriad of ways, by which time such questions will
have become largely moot, shocking as they may seem to us today.

Yeah, Nick, it was sort of just plain old, mundane t-shirt printing
technology!  
  
But, in its very large (economically) and very sophisticated (complexity) way,
it was a blast.  
  
I worked for Intel from 1974 to 1986. I then did other things.  
  
But as a holder of Intel stock, and someone still interested in the
technology, I follow what Intel, Samsung, TSMC, the leaders in the chip
industry today, are doing.  
  
It bears very little resemblance to the Thinking Institutes which pontificate
about whether step-and-repeat cameras are Dangers to Our Existence or What
Laws do We Need to Head Off the AI Takeover.  
  
Good to see you blogging again. I would blog, maybe, except I did this for
about 50% of my waking hours from 1992 to around 2002. Then I lessened my
mailing list activity and got back to some more core stuff.

situation is really a disaster.)

Do you believe that if, at some point in future, we combine our experts
systems, tools, into a coherent framework of agency, this will be of no
advantage to the resulting agent that is large enough for it to pose a risk to
humanity?  
  
That's what I inferred from skimming over your conversation over at lesswrong.

_Do you believe that if, at some point in future, we combine our experts
systems, tools, into a coherent framework of agency, this will be of no
advantage to the resulting agent that is large enough for it to pose a risk to
humanity?_  
  
Stated this way, I don't even buy the "if" part -- combining software systems
is a difficult engineering problem that gets much harder as the total lines of
code increase. I've seen large software systems and "coherent" is not how I'd
describe them. :-) Software is going to become more fragmented, not more
combined.  
  
And of course as you state I do indeed believe that to the extent such
combined software is feasible it would not pose any kinds of problems that
specialized software had not posed long before and to a far greater degree.

Wei_Dai wrote (@lesswrong):  
  
 _" Given the benefits of specialization, how do you explain the existence of
general intelligence (i.e. humans)? Why weren't all the evolutionary niches
that humans current occupy already taken by organisms with more specialized
intelligence?  
  
My explanation is that generalized algorithms may be less efficient than
specialized algorithms when specialized algorithms are available, but
inventing specialized algorithm is hard (both for us and for evolution) so
often specialized algorithms simply aren't available. You don't seem to have
responded to this line of argument..."_  
  
As far as I can tell you already answered that by saying that humans are a
conglomerate of many specialized techniques rather than something that is
similar to AIXI.  
  
The confusion of which the question by Wei_Dai is a result is inherent in the
vagueness of the concept of an agent.  
  
Humans are not agents in the same sense that a cooperation, a country or
humanity as a whole is not an agent.  
  
What is usually referred to as an agent is an expected utility maximizer, a
rigid consequentialist that acts in a way that is globally and timelessly
instrumentally useful.  
  
Which is not how effects of evolution work or how any computationally limited
decision maker could possible work.  
  
It takes complex values, motivations, a society of minds and its cultural
evolution to yield behavior approximating agency.  
  
Complex values are the cornerstone of diversity, which in turn enables
creativity and drives the exploration of various conflicting routes. A
singleton with a stable utility-function lacks the feedback provided by a
society of minds and its cultural evolution.  
  
You need to have various different agents with different utility-functions
around to get the necessary diversity that can give rise to enough selection
pressure. A "singleton" won't be able to predict the actions of new and
improved versions of itself by just running sandboxed simulations. Not just
because of logical uncertainty but also because it is computationally
intractable to predict the real-world payoff of changes to its decision
procedures.  
  
You need complex values to give rise to the necessary drives to function in a
complex world. You can't just tell an AI to protect itself. What would that
even mean? What changes are illegitimate? What constitutes "self"? That are
all unsolved problems that are just assumed to be solvable when talking about
risks from AI.  
  
An AI with simple values will simply lack the creativity, due to a lack of
drives, to pursue the huge spectrum of research that a society of humans does
pursue. Which will allow an AI to solve some well-defined narrow problems, but
it will be unable to make use of the broad range of synergetic effects of
cultural evolution. Cultural evolution is a result of the interaction of a
wide range of utility-functions.

_humans are a conglomerate of many specialized techniques rather than
something that is similar to AIXI.  
_  
  
A good thing, too, because "AIXI" (i.e. Solomonoff induction, a generalized
model of machine learning) is uncomputable. Even learning with no guaruntees
is harder than cracking public key crypto in the general case. To make
learning efficient, you need to have some already existing information about
the particular environment being learned, or similarly a learning algorithm
that is specialized for that environment. The more relevant information you
have, the better adapted the algorithm, the easier it is to learn the rest.
Which gives us an economy of different learners specialized to different kinds
of environments.  
  
As for humans, we are certainly quite good at some important mental tasks, but
there are also tasks we're relatively quite bad at. Exact memories typically
being among them. Birds that can remember where in a landscape thousands of
nuts are buried, the long-term memories of seals, animals with "photographic
memories", etc. each in their own ways have specialized mental abilities our
unaided brains don't typically have. And of course computers can memorize
trillions of numbers, on top of being able to do arithmetic billions to
trillions of times faster, and many other tasks that require boolean logic,
arithmetic, and the like. And I'm not even counting the many sensory inputs
our unaided brains lack, which before the advent of technological sensory
modes caused us to miss out on most of the information available in our
environment.  
  
None of that stops humans from still having the best overall package of
specialties, especially with the help of the technology we create, like those
computers. But there is no magical "general intelligence" that we possess and
other entities do not -- just a different package wrapped up in a brain with a
higher brain/body ratio, hands for our brains to create that technology, and
language that allows us to form some sophisticated social relationships that
are very different from those of other animals. A very good bundle of
specialties, but missing some pieces we'd really now love to have (like the
memories of computers), and certainly not "general intelligence", which ranges
from the astronomically inefficient to the uncomputable.

Speaking of comparative intelligence, here's a fun little debate about whether
to use humans, monkeys, or robots to pick coconuts. Apparently monkeys can
climb ten times as many trees in a day as humans, but they have a hard time
telling whether a coconut is ripe. Not clear on what parts of the task the
robots do better or worse:

Wei Dai addressed your directly in his [latest
post](http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/dq9/work_on_security_instead_of_friendliness/)
at lesswrong.com, asking: _Work on Security Instead of Friendliness?_  
  
Here is my reply:  
  
For the sake of the argument I am going to assume that Nick Szabo shares the
views of the Singularity Institute that at some point there will exist a
vastly superhuman intelligence that cares to take over the world, which, as
far as I can tell, he doesn't.  
  
The question is not how to make systems perfectly secure but just secure
enough as to disable such an entity from easily acquiring massive resources.
Resources it needs to create e.g. new computational substrates or build
nanotech assemblers etc., everything that is necessary to take over the world.  
  
In his post, Wei Dai claims that it is 2012 and that _" malware have little
trouble with the latest operating systems and their defenses."_  
  
This is true and yet not relevant. What can be done with modern malware is
nowhere near sufficient to what an AI will have to do to take over the world.  
  
An AI won't just have to be able to wreck havoc but take _specific_ and
_directed_ control of highly volatile social and industrial institutions and
processes.  
  
It doesn't take anywhere near perfect security to detect and defend against
such large scale intrusions.

Here was my reply:  
  
(1) I'd rephrase the above [comment I posted under my "The Singularity" post
on this blog, reposted to Less Wrong by Wei Dai] to say that computer security
is among the two most important things one can study with regard to this
alleged threat [the robot apocalypse, assuming one wanted to take it
seriously].  
  
(2) The other important thing is law. Law is the "offensive approach to the
problem of security" in the sense I suspect you mean it (unless you mean
something more like the military). Law is very highly evolved, the work of
millions of people as smart or smarter than Yudkoswky over more than a
millenium, and tested empirically against the real world of real agents with a
real diversity of values every day. It's not something you can ever come close
to competing with by a philosophy invented from scratch.  
  
(3) I stand by my comment that "AGI" and "friendliness" are hopelessly
anthropomorphic, infeasible, and/or vague.  
  
(4) Computer "goals" are only usefully studied against actual algorithms, or
clearly defined mathemetical classes of algorithms, not vague and imaginary
concepts. Perhaps you can make some progress by for example advancing the
study of postconditions, which seem to be the closest analog to goals in the
software engineering world. One can imagine a world where postconditions are
always checked, for example, and other software ignores the output of software
that has violated one of its postconditions.

@Nick Szabo  
  
Not sure if you saw the movie [Eagle
Eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Eye), but it nicely highlights how
those people probably perceive your law commentary.  
  
You have to realize the following when arguing with those people.  
  
Namely their premises, which are very roughly:  
  
1.) There will soon be a superhuman intelligence.  
2.) It will be a master of science and social engineering.  
2.b.) It will be able to take over the world by earning money over the
internet, control people by making phone calls and sending emails, and
ordering equipment to invent molecular nanotechnology.  
3.) It will interpret its goals in a completely verbatim way without wanting
to refine those goals.  
4.) It will want to protect those goals and in doing so take over the world
and the universe.  
5.) Any goal short of a full-fledged coherent extrapolation of the volition of
all of humanity will lead to the destruction of human values either as a side-
effect or because humans are perceived to be a security risk.  
  
It all sounds incredible crazy, naive and absurd. But as long as you don't
argue against those premises they will just conjecture arbitrary amounts of
intelligence, i.e. magic, to "refute" any your more specific arguments.

On of the key pieces of evidence they like to cite is something they call the
[AI-Box Experiment](http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox/). An unpublished,
not reproducible chat between Eliezer Yudkowsky and a few strangers where he
played the role of an AI trying to convince the gatekeeper, played by the
other person, to release it into the world.  
  
One of the rules, which basically allows the AI to assert anything, is as
follows:  
  
 _" The Gatekeeper must remain engaged with the AI and may not disengage by
setting up demands which are impossible to simulate. For example, if the
Gatekeeper says "Unless you give me a cure for cancer, I won't let you out"
the AI can say: "Okay, here's a cure for cancer" and it will be assumed,
within the test, that the AI has actually provided such a cure. Similarly, if
the Gatekeeper says "I'd like to take a week to think this over," the AI party
can say: "Okay. (Test skips ahead one week.) Hello again.""_

@nick: Wise choice.  
  
With the AI box nonsense - why one would even bother building AI so general
that it will want out of the box... I thought that this was about a boxed mind
upload or other neural network derived AI.  
  
Generally this singularity/rationalism community has very strong belief in
powers of their reason (as per philosophy of rationalism), and they mix up
rationalism and rationality.  
  
  
When talking of the AGI that others allegedly would create, they point out how
bad it would be and how it would kill mankind.  
  
Whenever you point out to them that e.g. an algorithm which solves formally
defined problems is very practically useful (and can be tackled directly
without any further problems of defining what we want), they are trying to
convince you that it is much less useful than their notion of AGI that wants
real things, having forgotten the previous statement, or being unable to see
how generally useful something like mathematics is.  
  
It's true 1984 doublethink over there. Almost everyone with any sense has
evaporated, while the very few people with a clue (Wei Dai for example) read
their own sense into the scriptures, arguing something sensible but entirely
orthogonal to the nonsense of the whole group.

Principles of black swan events and being anti fragile in our
