Deploy previews are the latest improvement to our web hosting product.

This new feature allows you to preview a deployment before pushing it to
production. You can safely view what your site will look like before you merge
the pull request.

It should come in handy when you want to make sure that everything is in order
with the changes you want to make and avoid bad surprises due to unfortunate
oversights.

For some teams, this step is an integral part of their workflow.

### Deploy previews are live!

You can use deploy previews right as we speak!

The feature must be activated and configured in the settings. You can do so by
going to the siteâ€™s settings, clicking on `Build & Deploy` and interacting
with the `Deploy Contexts` box.

To start a deploy preview, simply create a pull request to your production
branch. The deploy preview will appear in the list of deploys of the site.

Click on the deploy tagged `Deploy Preview` to view it!

In addition, you are able to view the deploy preview right from the github
page of your pull request. Very handy for developers wanting to see the
changes resulting from a pull request!

If you are an existing Fleek user, you should have received an email from
Github to update your permissions. The permissions are necessary so you can
receive information about your deployments right from Github.
