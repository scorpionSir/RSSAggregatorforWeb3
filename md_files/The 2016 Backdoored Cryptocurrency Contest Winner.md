Thanks to a quite a bit of luck I won this years version of [the Underhanded
Crypto Contest](https://underhandedcrypto.com/2016/08/17/the-2016-backdoored-
cryptocurrency-contest-winner/) focused on crypto currencies. The submission
consists of [a
writeup](https://underhandedcrypto.com/2016/08/17/the-2016-backdoored-
cryptocurrency-contest-winner/) and - of course - [backdoored
code](https://github.com/jonasnick/2016_underhanded_crypto_contest/tree/master/submission).
