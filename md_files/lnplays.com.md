Saturday, June 23, 2018

Konstantin Nick ([@sputn1ck](https://twitter.com/sputn1ck)) and I build
lnplays.com for the Lighting Hackday in June 2018. You could play Pokémon via
the Lightning Network build. Pressing the buttons of the GameBoy to move the
player and to interact with the world would generate a lightning invoice.
Paying that invoice would send the pressed button to the game-backend and the
user could see the action over the live stream. The site not longer up, but
parts of it can still be seen on
[archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20180625193114/https://lnplays.com/).

#### c-lightning plugin: csvexportpays

A toy plugin for c-lightning to export all payments made with a c-lightning
node to a `.csv` file. I build this a few days after Blockstream released the
plugin support in c-lightning v0.7 to showcase how simple it is to build
plugins.

#### transactionfee.info (2018 version)

We build transactionfee.info in 2018 to raise awareness about the inefficient
use of block space by exchanges, services, and wallets. The project is a joint
effort with [Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/?utm_source=b10c_me) CEO
[@ziggamon](https://twitter.com/ziggamon).
