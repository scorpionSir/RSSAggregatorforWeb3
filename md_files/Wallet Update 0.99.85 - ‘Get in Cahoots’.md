### [Wallet Update 0.99.85 - 'Get in
Cahoots'](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/187001617347/wallet-
update-09985-get-in-cahoots)

In March [we introduced **Cahoots** within an experimental section of the
wallet](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/183378923792/collaborative-
transactions-cahoots). Cahoots is a suite of tools to create and handle
collaborative peer-to-peer CoinJoin transactions between two wallets. Unlike
our Whirlpool CoinJoin service, Cahoots transactions do not require a blinded
coordinator server to function. A bare bones implementation of PayJoin known
as Stowaway and an enhanced STONEWALL that we named STONEWALLx2 were added to
the wallet for advanced users to help test the bleeding edge of privacy
enhancing transactions.  

We are very excited to release these privacy features to the wider public as
of version 0.99.85. We have created what we hope is an intuitive and friendly
interface for performing an inherently complex task. As usual, these features
are a work in progress and your feedback will help refine the usability as
development progresses. With that all out of the way, let us dive right in.

You can get the latest update from [Google Play

## Toggle Cahoots before sending

You invoke Cahoots from the Send screen of your wallet. You will be asked to
choose between two types of Collaborative transaction.

## STONEWALLx2  

This transaction makes use of a collaborators UTXO set in addition to your own
to compose the transaction. The result is a high entropy "mini CoinJoin"
transaction. STONEWALLx2 is a great way to quickly mix on demand when sending
to any third party by enlisting the help of a privacy conscious friend. In
this transaction, both the sender and the collaborator split the miner fee
down the middle.

 **Bob wants to send to Charlie, so he gets Alice to STONEWALLx2 with him.**  

## Stowaway  

Stowaway is designed to blend in and look like a typical bitcoin transaction.
Outside observers will not be able to tell that the Stowaway transaction is a
two person CoinJoin. Additionally the true amount sent is not revealed on the
blockchain. Unlike STONEWALLx2, Stowaway transactions can only be sent to the
same person you are collaborating with. This makes Stowaway a great option for
mixing when paying your privacy conscious friend. In this transaction the
sender pays the full transaction fee.

 **Bob wants to send to Alice, so they do a Stowaway together.   **
