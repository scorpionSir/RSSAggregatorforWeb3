# Orchid Partners with LiquidVPN

Mar 2, 2020  
  

Orchid continues to gain new partners as it seeks to build a more fair, more
private, and more secure internet. Today, Orchid announces a partnership with
[LiquidVPN](https://www.liquidvpn.com/), one of the fastest and most popular
VPN services.

LiquidVPN, first established in 2013, hosts servers in 20 cities spread across
11 countries. Every server has a minimum guaranteed 1 Gbps speed, so users do
not have to sacrifice their speed for their security.

Users can pay for private bandwidth from LiquidVPN on a per-byte basis using
Orchid’s native currency, OXT, available on
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid). Existing LiquidVPN
subscribers can use their credentials in the Orchid app, and even combine them
with other privacy providers to construct multi-hop routes.

LiquidVPN founder Dave Cox said: “VPNs are an essential tool for security-
conscious internet users, and Orchid has added new levels of utility and
consumer choice to the VPN market. We know that they will be great partners as
we work together to keep our users and their data secure.”

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said: “Orchid’s privacy
network is growing every day, with more and more reliable bandwidth providers
joining the platform. Our partnership with LiquidVPN is another step toward
making privacy a community experience.”
