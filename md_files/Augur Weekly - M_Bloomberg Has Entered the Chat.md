> #### `Election Betting Roundup`

[![Image](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5440f4fe-37c8-4370-9456-277ef2d33909_1199x616.jpeg)](https://twitter.com/M_McDonough/status/1192805679498776577)

Well, that was quick. It seems like just yesterday Pete Buttigieg was winning
the sentiment of moderate Democrats in a march towards the best odds for the
nomination. As you can see in the above chart from Bloomberg’s [Michael
McDonough](https://twitter.com/M_McDonough), Buttigieg’s PredictIt odds had
been picking up steam against the flailing sentiment for fellow moderate Joe
Biden and chief progressive opponent, Elizabeth Warren.  
  
Alas, former NY Mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg, perhaps sensing the
viability of his candidacy as a moderate Democrat now more than ever, [has
filed paperwork to enter the
race](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-
president-2020.html?mod=article_inline). _What’s emboldened this move?_
Bloomberg indicated as recently as mid-October that he would [consider a
run](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/14/bloomberg-signals-he-would-run-for-
president-if-biden-struggles-against-warren.html) if Biden were to drop out.
Now, with Biden’s struggles to regain momentum following the fallout from the
Hunter Biden/Ukraine news; coupled with [Beto
O’Rourke](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-
out.html) dropping out of the race, and Buttigieg’s relative inexperience; the
former Mayor felt now was the time to make his move.

 **It seems the betting public agrees on his chances.** In one day Bloomberg
rose from .03 to as high as .13/share, pulling past or even with popular
candidates Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang and pulling down on the prices of
Biden, Buttigieg, and Warren. He now sits at .11/share, within .05 of
Buttigieg, .09 of Biden, and .19 of favorite, Warren.

Another interesting thing to look at is the
[comparison](https://twitter.com/jipkin/status/1192574146363842560) between
the timing of Bloomberg’s announcement and the betting activity, with his odds
beginning to spike ~3h before the story broke. One might think to immediately
blame insiders taking a position. However, after deeper inspection, an [errant
tweet](https://twitter.com/whoischrisbaker/status/1192515415148236800)
describing Bloomberg’s team gathering signatures in Alabama may have been the
culprit. This goes to show, **Savvy bettors with the right alerts can gain
material advantages** in the age of instant reporting.

In other news, betting markets continue to value the potential of another
candidate throwing her hat in the ring:

Excuse Nate’s language, but he has somewhat of a point. **The limits on
PredictIt distort what truly accessible markets might look like**. As we move
closer to Augur v2’s launch by the day, it might be a good idea to consider
the relative advantages for the political sharp in comparison to incumbent
platforms.

Elsewhere, despite his **odds of impeachment making fresh highs** (0.80/share)
this week, President Donald Trump’s odds to win the General 2020 Election
remain relatively unchanged. In contrast, the slide in the odds of his chief
Democratic opponents Warren and Biden persisted.

As a reminder, come Q1 2020,  **[Augur](https://www.augur.net/) will be the
only platform for political betting with no limits, the lowest fees, and
unbeatable odds.**
