> ####  **Election Betting Roundup**

election-calendar.html)

Election season is upon us, and political prediction markets are heating up.
Besides the popularity of these markets increasing in an election year, the
number of venues to trade them (PredictIt, Betfair, Augur v2 in Q1) is
increasing as well.

With the incumbent, President Trump, hailing from the GOP, this early election
season brings the Democratic nomination into focus. There are a number of ways
to get exposure to the overall race or specific pieces of it.

### 1) DemNom Market 🗳️

The DemNom market is the conference finals of politics; and with no clear-cut
leader heading into Primary season, this race is shaping up to be contentious.
Sanders and Biden are the current frontrunners, trading for a combined
72c/share on PredictIt, but several viable candidates linger behind them:
Warren at 10c/share, Bloomberg at 13c/share, Buttigieg at 8c/share, and Yang
at 5c/share.

### 2) 2020 Presidential Market 🇺🇸

Whoa there, cowboy, I thought we were talking DemNom here. Well, it turns out
that there will be some interesting hedging and arbitrage opportunities
between the DemNom prices and the prices for the 2020 General Election. These
moves can be a bit risky, so be sure to consider all of the implications of
such a strategy. The main factor to anticipate is how individual nominees’
respective victories might affect the odds of beating DJT.

### 3) Debate Markets 🗣️

To date, the debates have been rather cordial. As the stakes increase, expect
to see more spirited and contentious statements and perhaps a good, old-
fashioned back and forth. In Tuesday’s debate, we saw the winds of
congeniality begin to change between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren:

As candidates start to feel their backs against the wall, look out for more
sparks. And with more sparks comes a slew of potential debate prop markets.
Given the propensity for candidates to reach for social media-digestible
soundbites, this should be a fun debate season.

### 4) Individual Primaries/Caucuses ☑️

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420d0f69-eaac-4a13-bd5a-5e32aaf82f82_2050x950.png)](https://guesser.com/market/9e3282cc)

The first contest, Iowa’s Democratic Caucus, is fast approaching and you can
make your wagers on [Guesser](https://guesser.com/), an app built with Augur.

Iowa’s Caucus on February 3rd, and is followed by New Hampshire’s Primary on
February 11th, Nevada’s Caucus on February 22nd, and South Carolina’s Primary
on February 29th. These early races represent the calm before the storm.

March 3rd brings Super Tuesday, where 14 state contests that day will kick off
a concentrated group of state races between then and June.
