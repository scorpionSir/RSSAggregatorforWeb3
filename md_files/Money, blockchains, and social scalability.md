###  Money, blockchains, and social scalability

###  **Introduction**

Blockchains are all the rage. The oldest and biggest blockchain of them all is
[Bitcoin](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/), which over its eight-year
history so far starshipped in value from 10,000 bitcoins per pizza (before
there were exchanges that priced bitcoin in traditional currencies) to over
$1,000 per bitcoin. As of this writing Bitcoin has a market capitalization of
over $16 billion. Running non-stop for eight years, with almost no financial
loss on the chain itself, it is now in important ways the most reliable and
secure financial network in the world.

  

The secret to Bitcoin's success is certainly not its computational efficiency
or its scalability in the consumption of resources.  Specialized Bitcoin
hardware is designed by highly paid experts to perform only one particular
function - to repetitively solve a very specific and intentionally very
expensive kind of computational puzzle. That puzzle is called a proof-of-work,
because the sole output of the computation is just a proof that the computer
did a costly computation. Bitcoin's puzzle-solving hardware probably consumes
in total over 500 megawatts of electricity.  And that is not the only feature
of Bitcoin that strikes an engineer or businessman who is focused on
minimizing resource costs as highly quixotic. Rather than reduce its protocol
messages to be as few as possible, each Bitcoin-running computer sprays the
Internet with a redundantly large number of "inventory vector" packets to make
very sure that all messages get accurately through to as many other Bitcoin
computers as possible.  As a result, the Bitcoin blockchain cannot process as
many transactions per second as a traditional payment network such as PayPal
or Visa. Bitcoin offends the sensibilities of resource-conscious and
performance-measure-maximizing engineers and businessmen alike.

  

Instead, the secret to Bitcoin's success is that its prolific resource
consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more
valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an
institution -\- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people
repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which
constrain or motivate participants' behaviors -- to overcome shortcomings in
human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution
that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is
about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond
to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of
participants in those institutions or relationships grow.  It's about human
limitations, not about technological limitations or physical resource
constraints. There are separate engineering disciplines, such as computer
science, for assessing the physical limitations of a technology itself,
including the resource capacities needed for a technology to handle a greater
number of users or a greater rate of use. Those engineering scalability
disciplines are not, except by way of contrast with social scalability, the
subject of this essay.  
  
Even though social scalability is about the cognitive limitations and behavior
tendencies of minds, not about the physical resource limitations of machines,
it makes eminent sense, and indeed is often crucial, to think and talk about
the social scalability of a technology that facilitates an institution. The
social scalability of an institutional technology depends on how that
technology constrains or motivates participation in that institution,
including protection of participants and the institution itself from harmful
participation or attack.  One way to estimate the social scalability of an
institutional technology is by the number of people who can beneficially
participate in the institution. Another way to estimate social scalability is
by the extra benefits and harms an institution bestows or imposes on
participants, before, for cognitive or behavioral reasons, the expected costs
and other harms of participating in an institution grow faster than its
benefits.  The cultural and jurisdictional diversity of people who can
beneficially participate in an institution is also often important, especially
in the global Internet context. The more an institution depends on local laws,
customs, or language, the less socially scalable it is.

  

Without institutional and technological innovations of the past, participation
in shared human endeavors would usually be limited to at most about 150 people
- the famous "Dunbar number".  In the Internet era, new innovations continue
to scale our social capabilities. In this article I will discuss how
blockchains, and in particular public blockchains that implement
cryptocurrencies, increase social scalability, even at a dreadful reduction in
computational efficiency and scalability.

_Cognitive capacity - here in the form of the relative size of a species'
neocortex - set limits on how large primate groups can be.  Maintaining animal
or intimate human groups requires extensive emotional communications and
investments in relationships, such as grooming in primates and gossiping,
humor, story-telling, and other conversations, songs, and play in traditional
human groups. Overcoming human cognitive limits to who or how many people can
participate in an institution - the famous "Dunbar number" of around 150
people -- requires institutional and technological innovation.
([Source](http://whatsupnah.com/2009/02/twitter-vs-the-dunbar-number-and-the-
rise-of-weak-ties/)) _

    

Innovations in social scalability involve institutional and technological
improvements that move function from mind to paper or mind to machine,
lowering cognitive costs while increasing the value of information flowing
between minds, reducing vulnerability, and/or searching for and discovering
new and mutually beneficial participants.  [Alfred North
Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead) said, "It is
a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent
people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of
thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization
advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform
without thinking about them." Friedrich Hayek added: "We make constant use of
formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through
the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which
individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and
institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved
successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of
the civilization we have built up."

  

A wide variety of innovations reduce our vulnerability to fellow participants,
intermediaries, and outsiders, and thereby lower our need to spend our scarce
cognitive capacities worrying about how an increasingly large number of
increasingly diverse people might behave. Another class of improvements
motivates the accurate collection and transmission of valuable information
between an increasing number and variety of participants. Yet other advances
enable a wider number or variety of mutually beneficial participants can
discover each other.  All these kinds of innovations have over the course of
human prehistory and history improved social scalability, sometimes
dramatically so, making our modern civilization with its vast global
population feasible. Modern information technology (IT), especially by making
use of the historically recent discoveries of computer science, can often
discover many more mutually beneficial matches, can improve motivations for
information quality, and can reduce the need for trust within certain kinds of
institutional transactions, with respect to an increasingly large number and
variety of people, thereby further increasing social scalability in some very
important ways.

  

Information flows between minds - what I have called [intersubjective
protocols](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/tradition.html)
- include spoken and written words, custom (tradition), the contents of law
(its rules, customs, and case precedents), a variety of other symbols (e.g.
"star" ratings common in online reputation systems), and market prices, among
many others.

  

Trust minimization is reducing the vulnerability of participants to each
other's and to outsiders' and intermediaries' potential for harmful behavior.
Most institutions which have undergone a lengthy cultural evolution, such as
law (which lowers vulnerability to violence, theft, and fraud), as well as
technologies of security, reduce, on balance, and in more ways than the
reverse, our vulnerabilities to, and thus our needs to trust, our fellow
humans, compared with our vulnerabilities before these institutions and
technologies evolved. In most cases an often trusted and sufficiently
trustworthy institution (such as a market) depends on its participants
trusting, usually implicitly, another sufficiently trustworthy institution
(such as contract law). These trusted institutions in turn traditionally
implement a variety of accounting, legal, security, or other controls that
make them usually and sufficiently, at least for facilitating the
functionality of their client institutions, trustworthy, by minimizing
vulnerability to their own participants (such as accountants, lawyers,
regulators, and investigators). An innovation can only partially take away
some kinds of vulnerability, i.e. reduce the need for or risk of trust in
other people. There is no such thing as a fully trustless institution or
technology.

  

The nonexistence of complete trustlessness is true even of our strongest
security technology, encryption. Although some cryptographic protocols do
guarantee certain specific data relationships with astronomically high
probability against opponents with astronomically high computing power, they
do not provide complete guarantees when accounting for all possible behaviors
of all participants. For example, encryption can strongly protect an e-mail
from direct eavesdropping by third parties, but the sender still trusts the
recipient to not forward or otherwise divulge the contents of that email,
directly or indirectly to any undesired third parties. As another example, in
our strongest consensus protocols harmful behavior by certain fractions of
participants or intermediaries well short of 100% (as measured by their
computing power, stake-holding, or individuation and counting) can compromise
the integrity of transactions or information flows between participants and
thereby on balance harm the participants.  The historically recent
breakthroughs of computer science can reduce vulnerabilities, often
dramatically so, but they are far from eliminating all kinds of
vulnerabilities to the harmful behavior of any potential attacker.

  

Matchmaking is facilitating the mutual discovery of mutually beneficial
participants. Matchmaking is probably the kind of social scalability at which
the Internet has most excelled. Social networks like Usenet News, Facebook,
and Twitter facilitate the mutual discovery of like-minded or otherwise
mutually entertaining or mutually informing people (and even future spouses!).
After they have allowed people more likely to be of mutual benefit to discover
each other, social networks then facilitate relationships at various levels of
personal investment, from casual to frequent to obsessive. [Christopher
Allen](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/previous/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html)
among others has done some interesting and detailed analyses about group size
and time spent mutually interacting in online games and associated social
networks.

  

eBay, Uber, AirBnB, and online financial exchanges have brought social
scalability via often great improvements in commercial matchmaking: searching
for, finding, bringing together, and facilitating the negotiation of mutually
beneficial commercial or retail deals.  These or related services also
facilitate performances such as payment and shipping, as well as verification
that other obligations undertaken by strangers in these deals have been
performed and communication about the quality of such performances (as with
"star rating" systems, Yelp reviews, and the like).

  

Whereas the main social scalability benefit of the Internet has been
matchmaking, the predominant direct social scalability benefit of blockchains
is trust minimization. A blockchain can reduce vulnerability by locking in the
integrity of some important performances (such as the creation and payment of
money) and some important information flows, and in the future may reduce the
vulnerability of the integrity of some important matchmaking functions.  Trust
in the secret and arbitrarily mutable activities of a private computation can
be replaced by verifiable confidence in the behavior of a generally immutable
public computation. This essay will focus on such vulnerability reduction and
its benefit in facilitating a standard performance beneficial to a wide
variety of potential counterparties, namely trust-minimized money.

####  **Money and Markets**

Money and markets directly benefit the participants in each particular trade
by the market matching a buyer with a mutually beneficial seller and by a
widely acceptable and standardized counter-performance (money).  I use markets
here in the sense Adam Smith used the term: not as a specific place or service
where buyers and sellers are brought together (although it might sometimes
involve these), but rather the broad set of typically pairwise exchanges
whereby the supply chain that makes a product is coordinated.

  

Money and markets also incentivize creation of more accurate price signals
that reduce negotiation costs and errors for participants in other similar
exchanges.  The potent combination of money and market thereby allowed a far
higher number and variety of participants to coordinate their economic
activities than previous exchange institutions, which more resembled bilateral
monopolies than competitive markets.

  

Markets and money involve matchmaking (bringing together buyer and seller),
trust reduction (trusting in the self-interest rather than in the altruism of
acquaintances and strangers), scalable performance (via money, a widely
acceptable and reusable medium for counter-performance), and quality
information flow (market prices).

  

The greatest early thinker about money and markets was Adam Smith.  At the
dawn of the industrial revolution in Britain, Smith observed in _The Wealth of
Nations_ how making even the most humble of products depended, directly and
indirectly, on the work of large numbers of a wide variety of people:

> > _Observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or day-laborer in
> a civilized and thriving country, and you will perceive that the number of
> people of whose industry a part, though but a small part, has been employed
> in procuring him this accommodation, exceeds all computation. The woolen
> coat, for example, which covers the day laborer, as coarse and rough as it
> may appear, is the produce of the joint labor of a great multitude of
> workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder,
> the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser,
> with many others, must all join their different arts in order to complete
> even this homely production. How many merchants and carriers, besides, must
> have been employed in transporting the materials from some of those workmen
> to others who often live in a very distant part of the country! How much
> commerce and navigation in particular, how many shipbuilders, sailors, sail
> makers, rope makers, must have been employed in order to bring together the
> different drugs made use of by the dyer, which often come from the remotest
> corners of the world! What a variety of labor, too, is necessary in order to
> produce the tools of the meanest of those workmen! To say nothing of such
> complicated machines as the ship of the sailor, the mill of the fuller, or
> even the loom of the weaver, let us consider only what a variety of labor is
> requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which
> the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for
> smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be
> made use of in the smelting-house, the brick maker, the brick layer, the
> workmen who attend the furnace, the millwright, the forger, the smith, must
> all of them join their different arts in order to produce them. Were we to
> examine, in the same manner, all the different parts of his dress and
> household furniture, the coarse linen shirt which he wears nest his skin,
> the shoes which cover his feet, the bed which he lies on, and all the
> different parts which compose it, the kitchen grate at which be prepares his
> victuals, the coals which he makes use of for that purpose, dug from the
> bowels of the earth, and brought to him perhaps by a long sea and a long
> land carriage, all the other utensils of his kitchen, all the furniture of
> his table, the knives and forks, the earthen or pewter plates upon which he
> serves up and divides his victuals, the different hands employed in
> preparing his bread and his beer, the glass window which lets in the heat
> and the light, and keeps out the wind and the rain, with all the knowledge
> and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy invention, without
> which these northern parts of the world could scarce have afforded a very
> comfortable habitation, together with the tools of all the different workmen
> employed in producing those different conveniences; if we examine, I say,
> all these things, and  consider what a variety of labor is employed about
> each of them, we shall be sensible that without the assistance and co-
> operation of many thousands, the very meanest person in a civilized country
> could not be provided, even according to what we may falsely imagine the
> easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated._

And this was before the many successive waves of industrial revolution and
globalization between 1776 and now that refined, elaborated, and extended the
division of labor many times more. Rather than trusting in the unlikely
altruism of so many strangers, markets and money create many pairings of
mutual benefit and thus motivate this large network of mutually oblivious
people to act in our interests:  

> _In civilized society man stands at all times in need of the cooperation and
> assistance of great multitudes, while his whole life is scarce sufficient to
> gain the friendship of a few persons …[In contrast to other animals, man has
> an almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is vain for
> him to expect it from their benevolence only.  [Exchange is the] manner in
> which we obtain from another the far greater part of those good offices
> which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher,
> the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard
> for their own interest. _

  

Smith goes on to describe how division of labor, and thus labor productivity,
depends on the extent of the network of pairwise exchanges: "As it is the
power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labor, so the
extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power,
or, in other words, by the extent of the market".  As the exchange network
around a country and around the globe grows, involving a greater number and
variety of producers, so grows the division of labor and thereby labor
productivity.

  

Money facilitates social scalability by increasing the opportunities for this
exchange. By lowering coincidence problems (coincidence-of-wants in exchange
and coincidence-of-want-and-event in unilateral transfers), via a widely
acceptable and reusable form of wealth storage and transfer, money greatly
lowered transaction costs, making possible more exchanges of a greater variety
of goods and services involving exchanges and other wealth transfer
relationships with a much larger number and much wider variety of people.

  

A wide variety of media, from oral language itself,
[clay](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/the-playdough-protocols/), paper,
telegraph, radio, and computer networks, have served to communicate offers,
acceptances, and the resulting deals and prices, as well as performance
monitoring and other business communications. One of the most knowledgeable
observations of the price network produced by markets and money can be found
in Friedrich Hayek's essay, ["The Use of Knowledge in
Society"](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html): _ _  

> _  In a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed
> among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of
> different people…in any society in which many people collaborate, this
> planning, whoever does it, will in some measure have to be based on
> knowledge which, in the first instance, is not given to the planner but to
> somebody else, which somehow will have to be conveyed to the planner. The
> various ways in which the knowledge on which people base their plans is
> communicated to them is the crucial problem for any theory explaining the
> economic process, and the problem of what is the best way of utilizing
> knowledge initially dispersed among all the people is at least one of the
> main problems of economic policy--or of designing an efficient economic
> system…_ _The mere fact that there is one price for any commodity --or
> rather that local prices are connected in a manner determined by the cost of
> transport, etc.--brings about the solution which (it is just conceptually
> possible) might have been arrived at by one single mind possessing all the
> information which is in fact dispersed among all the people involved in the
> process…_ _The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw
> material, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful
> of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity
> could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the
> material or its products more sparingly;  i.e., they move in the right
> direction….The price system is just one of those formations which man has
> learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the
> best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it.
> Through it not only a division of labor but also a coordinated utilization

> solution is produced by the interactions of people each of whom possesses
> only partial knowledge._

####  **The Social Scalability of Network Security**

Where long ago we used clay, and more recently paper, today programs and
protocols running on our computers and data networks implement most of our
commercial dealings. While this has greatly improved matchmaking and
information flow, it has come at the cost of an increase in vulnerability to
harmful behavior.

  

As networks grow, more people with fewer mutually understood habits of and
constraints on behavior are added.  Security via root-trusting access control,
designed for small and chummy offices like Bell Labs where co-workers were
well known and income and expenditures well controlled by paper procedures
rather than performed on these office computers, breaks down as an efficient
and effective security mechanism as organizations become larger, as
organizational boundaries are crossed, and as more valuable and concentrated
resources such as money are put on or activated via the computers. The more
strangers one receives emails from, the more likely one is likely to get a
phishing attack or a malware-laced attachment.  Traditional computer security
is not very socially scalable. As I describe in [The Dawn of Trustworthy
Computing](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-
computing.html):

> _When we currently use a smart phone or a laptop on a cell network or the
> Internet, the other end of these interactions typically run on other solo
> computers, such as web servers. Practically all of these machines have
> architectures that were designed to be controlled by a single person or a
> hierarchy of people who know and trust each other. From the point of view of
> a remote web or app user, these architectures are based on full trust in an
> unknown "root" administrator, who can control everything that happens on the
> server: they can read, alter, delete, or block any data on that computer at
> will.   Even data sent encrypted over a network is eventually unencrypted
> and ends up on a computer controlled in this total way. With current web
> services we are fully trusting, in other words we are fully vulnerable to,
> the computer, or more specifically the people who have access to that
> computer, both insiders and hackers, to faithfully execute our orders,
> secure our payments, and so on. If somebody on the other end wants to ignore
> or falsify what you've instructed the web server to do, no strong security
> is stopping them, only fallible and expensive human institutions, which
> often stop at national borders._

  

Many server computers are not valuable enough for insiders or outsiders to
attack. But an increasing number of others contain valuable concentrations of
resources, motivating attack. Centralized root-trusting security scales
poorly. As the resources controlled by computers become more valuable and more
concentrated, traditional root-trusting security becomes more like the "call
the cop" security we are used to in the physical world.  Fortunately, with
blockchains we can do much better for many of our most important computations.

####  **Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies**

Scalable markets and prices require scalable money. Scalable money requires
scalable security, so that a greater number and variety of people can use the
currency without losing its integrity against forgery, inflation, and theft.

  

An individual or group communicating under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto" brought
Bitcoin to the Internet in 2009. Satoshi's breakthrough with money was to
provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to
counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally
expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally
expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social
scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and
fully trusted intermediary.

_Financial controls on computational steroids: a blockchain as an army of
robots, each checking up on each other 's work._

    

When we can secure the most important functionality of a financial network by
computer science rather than by the traditional accountants, regulators,
investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from a system that is manual, local,
and of inconsistent security to one that is automated, global, and much more
secure. Cryptocurrencies, when implemented properly on public blockchains, can
substitute an army of computers for a large number of traditional banking
bureaucrats. _"_ These block chain computers will allow us to put the most
crucial parts of our online protocols on a far more reliable and secure
footing, and make possible fiduciary interactions that we previously dared not
do on a global network."
([Source](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-
computing.html))  
  
The characteristics most distinctively valuable in blockchain technology in
general, and Bitcoin in particular -- for example

  * independence from existing institutions for its basic operations
  * ability to operate seamlessly across borders

come from the high levels of security and reliability a blockchain can
maintain without human intervention. Without that high security it's just a
gratuitously wasteful distributed database technology still tied to the local
bureaucracies it would have to depend upon for its integrity.

_Since the mid-20 th century computing has increased in efficiency by many
orders of magnitude, but humans are using the same brains. This has created
plenty of possibility for overcoming human limitations, and institutions based
solely on human minds, with computational capabilities, including in security,
doing what they do best, with human minds doing what they still do best. As a
result, humans have no more raw mental ability to scale up our institutions
than we ever have. But there is plenty of potential for improving social
scalability by replacing some human functions with computational ones. (An
important note - this argument depends on the slope, not the absolute
position, of the human ability line.  The absolute position shown above is
arbitrary and depends on what human "computation" we are measuring)._

  

A new centralized financial entity, a trusted third party without a "human
blockchain" of the kind employed by traditional finance, is at high risk of
becoming the next Mt. Gox; it is not going to become a trustworthy financial
intermediary without that bureaucracy.

  

Computers and networks are cheap.  Scaling computational resources requires
cheap additional resources. Scaling human traditional institutions in a
reliable and secure manner requires increasing amounts accountants, lawyers,
regulators, and police, along with the increase in bureaucracy, risk, and
stress that such institutions entail. Lawyers are costly. Regulation is to the
moon. Computer science secures money far better than accountants, police, and
lawyers.

  

In computer science there are fundamental security versus performance
tradeoffs. Bitcoin's automated integrity comes at high costs in its
performance and resource usage. Nobody has discovered any way to greatly
increase the computational scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain, for example
its transaction throughput, and demonstrated that this improvement does not
compromise Bitcoin's security.

  

It is probable that no such big but integrity-preserving performance
improvement is possible for the Bitcoin blockchain; this may be one of these
unavoidable tradeoffs.  Compared to existing financial IT, Satoshi made
radical tradeoffs in favor of security and against performance. The seemingly
wasteful process of mining is the most obvious of these tradeoffs, but Bitcoin
also makes others.  Among them is that it requires high redundancy in its
messaging.  Mathematically provable integrity would require full broadcast
between all nodes.  Bitcoin can't achieve that but to even get anywhere close
to a good approximation of it requires a very high level of redundancy.  So a
1 MB block consumes far more resources than a 1 MB web page, because it has to
be transmitted, processed, and stored with high redundancy for Bitcoin to
achieve its automated integrity.

  

These necessary tradeoffs, sacrificing performance in order to achieve the
security necessary for independent, seamlessly global, and automated
integrity, mean that the Bitcoin blockchain itself cannot possibly come
anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers and maintain the automated
integrity that creates its distinctive advantages versus these traditional
financial systems. Instead, a less trust-minimized peripheral payment network
(possibly [Lightning](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) )
will be needed to bear a larger number of lower-value bitcoin-denominated
transactions than Bitcoin blockchain is capable of, using the Bitcoin
blockchain to periodically settle with one high-value transaction batches of
peripheral network transactions.

  

Bitcoin supports a lower rate transactions than Visa or PayPal, but due to its
stronger automated security these can be much more important transactions.
Anybody with a decent Internet connection and a smart phone who can pay
$0.20-$2 transaction fees - substantially lower than current remitance fees --
can access Bitcoin any where on the globe.  Lower value transactions with
lower fees will need to be implemented on peripheral bitcoin networks.

  

When it comes to small-b bitcoin, the currency, there is nothing impossible
about paying retail with bitcoin the way you'd pay with a fiat currency --
bitcoin-denominated credit and debt cards, for example, with all the
[chargeback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback) and transactions-per-
second capabilities of a credit or debit card. And there are also clever ways
to do peripheral bitcoin retail payments in which small value payments happen
off-chain and are only periodically bulk-settled on the Capital-B Bitcoin
blockchain. That blockchain is going to evolve into a high-value settlement
layer as bitcoin use grows, and we will see peripheral networks being used for
small-b bitcoin retail transactions.

  

When I designed [bit
gold](https://web.archive.org/web/20070616052640/http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-
gold.html) I already knew consensus did not scale to large transaction
throughputs securely, so I designed it with a two-tier architecture: (1) bit
gold itself, the settlement layer, and (2) [Chaumian digital
cash](http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF),
a peripheral payment network which would provide retail payments with high
transactions-per-second performance and privacy (through Chaumian blinding),
but would like Visa be a trusted third party and thus require a "human
blockchain" of accountants, etc. to operate with integrity.  The peripheral
payment network can involve only small value transactions, thereby requiring
much less of a human army to avoid the fate of Mt. Gox.

_Ralph Merkle: pioneer of public-key cryptography and inventor of hierarchical
hash-tree structures (Merkle trees)._

    

Money requires social scalability in its design, via security. For example it
should be very hard for any participant or intermediary to forge money (to
dilute the supply curve leading to undue or unexpected inflation).  Gold can
have value anywhere in the world and is immune from hyperinflation because its
value doesn't depend on a central authority.  Bitcoin excels at both these
factors and runs online, enabling somebody in Albania to use Bitcoin to pay
somebody in Zimbabwe with minimal trust in or and no payment of quasi-monopoly
profits to intermediaries, and with minimum vulnerability to third parties.

  

There are all sorts of definitions of "blockchain" out there, almost all of
them just implicitly broad hand-waving amid the mountains of marketing hype. I
suggest a clear definition that can be communicated to lay people.  It is a
blockchain if it has blocks and it has chains. The "chains" should be [Merkle
trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) or other cryptographic
structures with a similar integrity functionality of [post-
unforgeable](http://archive.is/T9Y8P#selection-103.0-103.30#Post-
unforgeable%20auditing%20logs)   integrity.  Also the transactions and any
other data whose integrity is protected by a blockchain should be replicated
in a way objectively tolerant to worst-case malicious problems and actors to
as high a degree as possible (typically the system can behave as previously
specified up to a fraction of 1/3 to 1/2 of the servers maliciously trying to
subvert it to behave differently).

_Bitcoin 's socially scalable security, based on computer science rather than
on police and lawyers, allows, for example, customers in Africa to pay
suppliers in China seamlessly across borders. A private blockchain cannot
accomplish this feat nearly as easily, since it would require an
identification scheme, certificate authority, and PKI shared between these
various jurisdictions.
([Source](https://twitter.com/pesa_africa/status/812618598443319297))_

  

Because of this fraction, and because of the (hopefully very rare) need to
update software in a manner that renders prior blocks invalid - an even
riskier situation called a hard fork -- blockchains also need a human
governance layer that is vulnerable to fork politics. The most successful
blockchain, Bitcoin, has maintained its immutable integrity via decentralized
decision-making among experts in the technology combined with a strong dogma
of immutability, under which only the most important and rare bug fixes and
design improvements, that cannot be made any other way, justify a hard fork.
Under this philosophy of governance accounting or legal decisions (such as
altering an account balance or undoing a transaction) never justify a hard
fork, but should be accomplished by traditional governance outside of (or on
top of) the system (e.g. via a court injunction forcing a Bitcoin user to send
a new transaction that effectively undoes the old one, or confiscating the
particular keys and thus the particular holdings of a particular user).

  

To say that data is post-unforgeable or immutable means that it can't be
undetectably alteredafter being committed to the blockchain. Contrary to some
hype this doesn't guarantee anything about a datum's provenance, or its truth
or falsity, before it was committed to the blockchain. That requires
additional protocols, often including expensive traditional controls.
Blockchains don't guarantee truth; they just preserve truth and lies from
later alteration, allowing one to later securely analyze them, and thus be
more confident in uncovering the lies. Typical computers are computational
etch-a-sketch, while blockchains are computational amber. Important data
should be committed to blockchain amber as early as possible, ideally directly
from and cryptographically signed by the device in which it was generated, to
maximize the blockchain's benefit in securing its integrity.

_A Merkle tree of four transactions (tx0 through tx3). Combined with a proper
replication and chains of transaction blocks protected by proof-of-work,
Merkle trees can make data such as transactions post-unforgeable by consensus.
In Bitcoin, a Merkle root hash securely summarizes and is used to verify the
unaltered state of all the transactions in a block._

  

My own 1998 ["secure property title"](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-
property-titles/) architecture had Merkle trees and replication of data
tolerant against an objective fraction of arbitrarily faulty software or
malicious actors, but not blocks.  It demonstrated my theory that you could
protect the integrity of globally shared data and transactions, and use that
ability to design a cryptocurrency (bit gold). It did not have the more
efficient and computationally scalable blocks-and-ledger system that Bitcoin
does. Also like today's private blockchains, secure property titles assumed
and required securely distinguishable and countable nodes.  
  
Given the objective 51% hashrate attack limit to some important security goals
of public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, we actually do care about the
distinguishable identity of the most powerful miners to answer the question
"can somebody convince and coordinate the 51%?

  

Blockchain security is objectively limited and blockchain governance is
heavily influenced by the potential for a 51% attack.  An attack of course
does not have to be called an "attack" by the attackers; instead they might
call it "enlightened governance" or "democracy in action".  Indeed some kinds
of software updates needed to fix bugs or otherwise improve the protocol
require a soft fork. Some other kinds of software updates require hard forks,
which in Bitcoin pose an even greater security and continuity risks than soft
forks. Blockchains, although reducing trust far more than any other network
protocols, are still far from trustless. Miners are partially trusted
fiduciaries, and those who are not expert developers or computer scientists
who have invested a great deal of time in learning the design principles and
codebase of a blockchain must place a great deal of faith in the expert
developer community, much as non-specialists who want to understand the
results of a specialized science do of the corresponding scientists. During a
hard fork exchanges can also be very influential by deciding which fork to
support with their order books and trade symbol continuity.

  

Public blockchains thus mostly but not entirely dodge the identity-is-hard
bullet and take care of its remaining problem of identifying the most powerful
miners at a higher "wet"/"social" level, where it is probably more
appropriate, rather than trying to securely map such an inherently wet (brain-
based) concept onto the protocol, as PKI ([public key
infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure))
rather awkwardly tries to do.

  

So I think some of the "private blockchains" qualify as bona fide blockchains;
others should go under the broader rubric of "distributed ledger" or "shared
database" or similar.  They are all very different from and not nearly as
socially scalable as public and permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin and
Ethereum.

  

All of the following are very similar in requiring an securely identified
(distinguishable and countable) group of servers rather than the arbitrary
anonymous membership of miners in public blockchains. In other words, they
require some other, usually far less socially scalable, solution to the [Sybil
(sockpuppet](http://changingminds.org/techniques/propaganda/sockpuppeting.htm))
attack problem:

  * [Private blockchains](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/07/on-public-and-private-blockchains/)
  * The "federated" model of [sidechains](https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf) (Alas, nobody has figured out how to do sidechains with any lesser degree of required trust, despite previous hopes or claims).  Sidechains can also be private chains, and it's a nice fit because their architectures and external dependencies (e.g. on a PKI) are similar.
  * [Multisig](https://coincenter.org/entry/what-is-multi-sig-and-what-can-it-do)-based schemes, even when done with blockchain-based smart contracts
  * Threshold-based "oracle" architectures for moving off-blockchain data onto blockchains

The dominant, but usually not very socially scalable, way to identify a group
of servers is with a PKI based on trusted [certificate
authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) (CAs). To
avoid the problem that [merely trusted third parties are security
holes](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/), reliable CAs
themselves must be expensive, labor-intensive bureaucracies that often do
extensive background checks themselves or rely on others (e.g. Dun and
Bradstreet for businesses) to do so.  (I once led a team that designed and
built such a CA).  CAs also act as a gatekeeper, rendering these permissioned
systems. CAs can become singular points of political control and failure.
"Public blockchains are automated, secure, and global, but identity is labor-
intensive, insecure, and local."

  

PKI-enabled private blockchains are a nice for banks and some other large
enterprises because they already have mature in-house PKIs that cover the
employees, partners, and private servers needed to approve important
transactions.  Bank PKIs are relatively reliable. We also have semi-reliable
CAs for web servers, but not generally speaking for web clients, even though
people have been working on the problem of client certificates since the
invention of the web: for example advertisers would love to have a more secure
alternative to phone numbers and cookies for tracking customer identities. Yet
it hasn't happened.  

  

PKI can work well for some important things and people but it is not nearly so
nice or so easy for lesser entities. Its social scalability is limited by the
traditional wet identity bureaucracy on which it depends.

_Some significant thefts in the broader bitcoin ecosystem. Whereas the Bitcoin
blockchain itself is probably the most secure financial network in existence
(and indeed must remain far more secure than traditional payment networks in
order to maintain its low governance costs and seamless cross-border
capability), its peripheral services based on older centralized web servers
are very insecure. (Source: author)_

  

We need more socially scalable ways to securely count nodes, or to put it
another way to with as much robustness against corruption as possible, assess
contributions to securing the integrity of a blockchain. That is what proof-
of-work and broadcast-replication are about: greatly sacrificing computational
scalability in order to improve social scalability.  That is Satoshi's
brilliant tradeoff.   It is brilliant because humans are far more expensive
than computers and that gap widens further each year.  And it is brilliant
because it allows one to seamlessly and securely work across human trust
boundaries (e.g. national borders), in contrast to "call-the-cop"
architectures like PayPal and Visa that continually depend on expensive,
error-prone, and sometimes corruptible bureaucracies to function with a
reasonable amount of integrity.  

####  **Conclusion**

The rise of the Internet as seen the rise of a variety of online institutions,
among them social networks, "long-tail" retail (e.g. Amazon), and a variety of
services that allow small and dispersed buyers and sellers to find and do
business with each other (eBay, Uber, AirBnB, etc.)  These are just the
initial attempts to take advantage of our new abilities.  Due to the massive
improvements in information technology over recent decades, the number and
variety of people who can successfully participate in an online institution is
far less often restricted by the objective limits of computers and networks
than it is by limitations of mind and institution that have usually have not
yet been sufficiently redesigned or further evolved to take advantage of those
technological improvements.  
  
These initial Internet efforts have been very centralized. Blockchain
technology, which implements data integrity via computer science rather than
via "call the cops", has so far made possible trust-minimized money --
cryptocurrencies - and will let us make progress in other financial areas as
well as other areas where transactions can be based primarily on data
available online.  
  
This is not to say that adapting our institutions to our new capabilities will
be easy, or indeed in particular cases anything short of difficult and
improbable. Utopian schemes are very popular in the blockchain community, but
they are not viable options. Reverse-engineering our highly evolved
traditional institutions, and even reviving in new form some old ones, will
usually work better than designing from scratch, than grand planning and game
theory. One important strategy for doing so was demonstrated by Satoshi -
sacrifice computational efficiency and scalability -- consume more cheap
computational resources -- in order to reduce and better leverage the great
expense in human resources needed to maintain the relationships between
strangers involved modern institutions such as markets, large firms, and
governments.

"The secret to Bitcoin's success is certainly not its computational efficiency
or its scalability in the consumption of resources"  
  
Success is a subjective term.  
  
1000usd (16bn cap) and 3tx/s after 8 years is not impressive in the grand
scheme of things.  
  
Especially, that the alarm bells have been sounded about the implications of
the 1MB limit 2 years ago. Today, it causes losses, inconvenience for everyone
but speculators trading with IOUs on exchanges.  
  
Insult to injury, the Core team became a group of incompetent narcissists who
live in denial and hide behind censorship.

There are two ways to scale it: Financially and technically. Lightning network
is financial scaling using financial hubs, which is more or less the same as
today's banking system.  
  
A better way is to make bitcoin technically scale-able through two layers:
Backbone consists of thousands of super nodes running on TB level network, and
second layer consists of billions of SPV nodes running mobile app, thus the
data traffic itself is scaled by 2 layer, and everyone would still do on-chain
transactions with minimum fee

"Lightning network is financial scaling using financial hubs, which is more or
less the same as today's banking system."  
  
So what you're telling us is that, in today's banking system, clients
digitally sign a transaction with their private key, opening a bi-directional
payment channel with a hub that has locked up 100% collateral on a secure
distributed ledger, and make payments to other people in the system, who may
have like accounts open with other hubs, by passing around digitally signed
transactions at line-rate through side channels, incrementing the amount paid
to the hub, to be settled at a later date by broadcasting another digitally
signed channel-close transaction that is confirmed on the same secure
distributed ledger as the channel-open transaction, netting the difference
between the hub and the client? I must have skipped that chapter during my
Finance class in college!

Nice Post. Just some comments on your paragraph:  
  
"The nonexistence of complete trustlessness is true even of our strongest
security technology, encryption. Although some cryptographic protocols do
guarantee certain specific data relationships with astronomically high
probability against opponents with astronomically high computing power, they
do not provide complete guarantees when accounting for all possible behaviors
of all participants. For example, encryption can strongly protect an e-mail
from direct eavesdropping by third parties, but the sender still trusts the
recipient to not forward or otherwise divulge the contents of that email,
directly or indirectly to any undesired third parties."  
  
This is not necessarily the case. Plausible deniability does exist for
encryption  
as does perfect forward secrecy, so you don't actually have to trust the
receiver not to share it, it just has to be a situation where there is more
than one possible interpretation for what they share. If there are for
instance 2 possible interpretations then it might be impossible to determine
which of the two is the correct interpretation without additional knowledge
found only in the brain of the receiver.  
  
The majority of the trust flows receiver -> sender because deception from the
sender is where the problem is. The receiver would have to trust the sender
not to lie or deceive more than the sender has to trust the receiver not to
tell anyone. So while it's never completely trustless it is not because of the
encryption but because of the ability of the sender to lie to the receiver.

On the topic of Bitcoin success and in response to the other posters, I don't
think we can consider Bitcoin a success. It achieved a goal but it never went
mainstream and probably never will.  
  
The issue with Bitcoin is it has no legitimacy and without legitimacy
marketing becomes almost impossible because people view it a certain way prior
to using it or understanding it. Perhaps Bitcoin would be successful if the
goal were to achieve 10 million users in 10 years but a social network can
achieve 10 million users in only 2 years. So the amount of users isn't a good
measure of success right? So adoption isn't a good measure of success if
adoption is going so slow not just for Bitcoin but the entire cryptospace?  
  
Mainstream adoption requires legitimacy and legitimacy is a scarce resource
which is difficult to acquire and easy to lose. Unfortunately MtGox took away
legitimacy from Bitcoin and Bitcoin may never recover, just as Ethereum lost
legitimacy after The DAO got hacked and may never recover from that.

At the current transaction capacity, Bitcoin allows for only 10 million people
saving a part of their monthly income in money they only control without the
approval of any bank or institution. That is if Bitcoin is used only for that
purpose, a more realistic number would probably be far less than 1 million
people. Is that the aim of a cypherpunk Mr Szabo?

@Anonymous: you didn't understand the essay. Many more people can use Bitcoin
indirectly, but probably only about the number you quote can use it directly.
There is no other way without sacrificing security and censorship-resistance:
the things that make Bitcoin more than an extremely inefficient database.  
  
If you don't agree with Nick (I do) the answer is to start an alternative
crypto-currency to Bitcoin and show that it does scale (it won't). Don't just
bump a magic number and break the most amazing system human civilization has
ever produced. Next time those that run this world will kill it before it gets
strong enough to be unkillable by any party on the planet.

The keys to social scalability are closely related to distribution of pricing
information and to exchange transaction costs. This discussion of disruption-
through-blockchain would be served by more examination of the gains previous
generations made or lost through such technologies as the clay tablet, the
written law, the rise of mercantile law, the voting mechanisms of Greece and
Rome, the shareholder corporation, moveable type, wireless. Our species has
made huge scaling advances from the Dunbar number of our wetware: what are the
mechanisms by which this scaling has evolved to our current state of huge
nations, inscrutable laws, suffocating regulations, international financial
vampire squid? Surely these have distributed price information increasingly
quickly, and made individual transactions less risky. Salvation will not be

The problem with proof of work is not that it is just ineficient - the problem
is that it is bound to waste nearlly all profits that it generates.  
  
But there is also this thing that wastefull proof of work is only needed for
timestamping. This does not need to be very trusted operation, given that the
timestampers don't know what they are stamping. So I imagine you could have a
PKI timestamping layer - plus a less trusted distributed layer that would add
meaning to the timestamps. This way we could get relatively low trust
requirements together with huge efficiency leap.

Can you rephrase this sentence:  
  
"This has created plenty of possibility for overcoming human limitations, and
institutions based solely on human minds, with computational capabilities,
including in security, doing what they do best, with human minds doing what
they still do best"  
  
I can't seem to make sense of it.

Great insights, I've been researching the blocksize debate and I couldn't make
sense of the aggressiveness on bodes sides. I didn't follow the bitcoin
community for years, since I'm a silent, confident holder who got tired of all
the daily drama  
  
If computer science prevents the bitcoin community, or rather: cryptocurrency
community in general, from scaling, it's all that matters. We're stuck with a
small blocksize on this layer, bigger ambitions are possible, but on layers on
top of the "bitgold" layer.

"Like most blogs worth my attention, this blog is updated only infrequently.
That is because the authors of blogs worth my attention only post when they
have something to say that is true, relevant and not already known by their
audience. Most of the human race does not have the skill to know when an idea
has these three properties. The skill is particularly rare in the fields of
politics and economics, which is why this blog is such a rare and valuable
thing." \-- [Richard Hollerith](http://dl4.jottit.com/)
