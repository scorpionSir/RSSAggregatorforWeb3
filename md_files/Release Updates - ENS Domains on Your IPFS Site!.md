# Release Updates - ENS Domains on Your IPFS Site!

![](https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/thumbnails-blog/Release-Update-
UI-rebrand.png)

This release brings the IPFS community ENS Domains! Since so much of the
Ethereum space uses IPFS for their sites and apps, ENS support has been one of
our most requested features.

# ENS Domain Support

You can now easily point an ENS domain to your IPFS site and have the content
automatically update for future deployments. Input your ENS domain and make
one transaction, we’ll take care of it for you from there. We use the ENS
smart contract’s “controller” role that keeps you in full control and
ownership of your ENS domain, while you delegate the day to day operations to
Fleek. [Check out](https://fleekhq.eth/) our Homepage on ENS! Whenever we make
updates to our Homepage, Fleek handles updating the content to our ENS Domain.

# Other Updates

We’ve released a few other bugs and enhancements while assisting our current
users. We pride ourselves on providing great customer support and the feedback
has been invaluable.

We’ve been working on a major release that you can learn about at our next
talk at the [IPFS Pinning Summit](https://ipfspinningsummit.com/)! Thanks IPFS
for the speaking invitation and congrats on an incredible 0.5 protocol
upgrade!
