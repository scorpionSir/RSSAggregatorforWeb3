# Getting Started on Fleek

![](https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/thumbnails-blog/getting-

So you’re ready to get started on Fleek? Well, let’s get right into it. In
this guide, we will walk through deploying a website to IPFS using Fleek. This
guide is most helpful if you are already signed up for Fleek. If you haven’t
already signed up you can [request early
access](https://terminalbeta.typeform.com/to/kionHH).

Let’s get started by signing up for Fleek and deploying a website:

### 1\. Add New Site

](../../static/22f5972452b302bb8edc6b2c60362485/869d7/Add%20New%20Site.png)

### 2\. Connect with GitHub

](../../static/2b22314558cd1cc209d10fcdcc025039/869d7/Connect%20with%20GitHub.png)

### 3\. **Select the GitHub account where you want to install Fleek**

#### **(Where the repository for the website or application you plan to deploy
is located)**

[ ![Install
Terminal](../../static/02cea81c6d924aa7c0bd87222574decc/d9199/Install%20Terminal.png)
](../../static/02cea81c6d924aa7c0bd87222574decc/869d7/Install%20Terminal.png)

### 4\. **Pick the repository you want to deploy**

[ ![Repository to
Deploy](../../static/4ec7157208dedbb975634f228789b546/d9199/Choose%20Repo2.png)
](../../static/4ec7157208dedbb975634f228789b546/913a1/Choose%20Repo2.png)

### **5**. **Fill in your build command and publish directory as described in
your package.json**

#### (We will auto-populate the build command and directory if we find it)

[ ![Unfilled Build
Settings](../../static/62532641622363d2951296d05d3f8c8c/d9199/Deploy%20Settings.png)
](../../static/62532641622363d2951296d05d3f8c8c/07d7d/Deploy%20Settings.png)

### **6**. **Deploy your Site!**

[ ![Deploy
Site](../../static/be1d2478482c137d9bc1d49b95cbfb4d/d9199/Deploy%20Settings%20Click.png)
](../../static/be1d2478482c137d9bc1d49b95cbfb4d/07d7d/Deploy%20Settings%20Click.png)

While your site is deploying you’re redirected to monitor its progress with
detailed logs during each step of the deployment.

[ ![Deploy
Progress](../../static/3aaea3363bb877f32a7c57ca9ba3d854/d9199/Deploy%20In%20Progress2.png)
](../../static/3aaea3363bb877f32a7c57ca9ba3d854/07d7d/Deploy%20In%20Progress2.png)

Once the site is deployed successfully, the site will be uploaded to IPFS and
the IPFS hash will be mapped to a Fleek subdomain. You can click on the Fleek
subdomain to preview your live site on IPFS!

![Success](../../static/9c4a34b4066e4ad12b931f6f3ba3a17c/d9199/Deploy%20Complete.png)
](../../static/9c4a34b4066e4ad12b931f6f3ba3a17c/07d7d/Deploy%20Complete.png)

Now that you have deployed a performant website on IPFS, let’s add or buy a
domain to your site. There are three ways to add a domain to your site: You
can add a subdomain, add a root domain, or purchase a new domain.

## Adding a Subdomain

### 1\. **Click “Add or Buy Custom Domain” on the overview tab in the getting
started, or go to the settings tab and navigate to the domain management
section using the left navigation**

[ ![Add
1](../../static/c8c7f0e50c28a1aefad06af0e39ac52c/d9199/Add%20Domain%201.png)
](../../static/c8c7f0e50c28a1aefad06af0e39ac52c/869d7/Add%20Domain%201.png)

[
![Add2](../../static/f3c6eb74aae0717efdddb584f9c2f77b/d9199/Add%20Domain%201%20Alt.png)
](../../static/f3c6eb74aae0717efdddb584f9c2f77b/edd6a/Add%20Domain%201%20Alt.png)

### **2\. Type in your subdomain that is managed in an external DNS provider
and click “Verify”**

[
![Verify](../../static/11f103b2a6ab804458e6d5266f8cb91a/d9199/Pick%20Domain%20Click.png)
](../../static/11f103b2a6ab804458e6d5266f8cb91a/869d7/Pick%20Domain%20Click.png)

### **3\. Click “Yes, Add Domain” to verify this domain is owned by you**

[
![Yes](../../static/d5e7fa634cbe0577bb52603519e631fa/d9199/Pick%20Domain%20Click%20Add.png)
](../../static/d5e7fa634cbe0577bb52603519e631fa/869d7/Pick%20Domain%20Click%20Add.png)

### 4\. Click on “Check DNS Configuration” next to your subdomain to see the
instructions to add the CNAME record to your domain in your DNS provider.

[ ![Check
DNS](../../static/8e69df78b58b749eb6cbb53f86c22e21/d9199/Check%20DNS.png)
](../../static/8e69df78b58b749eb6cbb53f86c22e21/edd6a/Check%20DNS.png)

### 5\. **Follow the instructions to add the CNAME record to your DNS
provider. Once you’ve created a record in your DNS provider, click “Verify DNS
Configuration” to check the propagation of the DNS to your site. If it fails
please wait a few more minutes for the DNS to finish propagating and try
again.**

](../../static/3f6ef9541e27562d0d305de3ea508951/869d7/Verify%20DNS.png)

### 6\. **Your site has successfully propagated and received a free SSL
certificate from Let’s Encrypt. You can see details about the SSL certificate
below in your domain management settings.**

## Adding a root domain

### 1\. **Click “Add or Buy Custom Domain” on the overview tab in the getting

### **2\. Type in your root domain that is managed in an external DNS provider
and click “Verify”**

### 4\. **The root domain and an additional www. Subdomain, to redirect to the
root domain, will be added to your domain management settings. Click on “Check
DNS Configuration” next to the root domain to see the instructions to add the
A record to your domain in your DNS provider for the root domain. For the www.
Subdomain configuration, follow step 4 through step 6 to get set up**
