# Orchid Continues to Build Momentum With Listing on CoinList

Apr 30, 2020  
  

CoinList Markets, a San Francisco-based digital asset platform, has announced
plans to allow its users to access Orchid's digital currency, OXT.

CoinList has serviced more than $800 million in token sales by over 10,000
global investors, as it provides a platform for startups to raise capital
using tools such as airdrops, token sales, and hackathons. After a successful
fundraising round in 2019, with support from the likes of Twitter CEO Jack
Dorsey, it launched a crypto exchange and wallet.

Orchid co-founder and CEO Dr. Steven Waterhouse said:

> We are thrilled to have such a trusted partner in CoinList. Our community
> can feel confident when purchasing OXT on a platform with a proven track
> record of regulatory compliance and security best practices."

CoinList President Andy Bromberg said:

> Orchid is a rare find in crypto — a product that directly benefits a huge
> number of people around the world, and one that is live today. We’re
> thrilled to be listing OXT for trading on CoinList to allow users to get
> access to Orchid’s services and participate in the community."

Orchid is a unique VPN: it is powered by a digital currency, so paying for
bandwidth doesn’t require any centralized party. VPN service in the app is
purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only for the
bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account by
creating an Ethereum address using Metamask or another Ethereum wallet, and
purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1 of ETH from CoinList or another exchange.
Once the account is created, a QR code appears that contains account
credentials that you can share with as many friends, family, or devices as
you’d like. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a 1-step
setup.

The CoinList announcement follows listings on Coinbase, Gemini, Bittrex
Global, OKEx, and five new Orchid app language translations (Mandarin,
Russian, Indonesian, Korean, and Japanese) [announced March 27th](/oxt-now-
live-on-okex/). As of April 30th, deposits for OXT on CoinList are open, with
trading to follow in the coming days.
