#  **Bakkt In It**

 **Bakkt In It**

On September 22, bitcoin futures began trading at Bakkt, an exchange and
digital asset custodian backed by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Not only is
CMTD an investor in Bakkt, but the firm had the pleasure of being involved in
the first trade on the exchange at 8:02 p.m. ET, at a price of $10,115.

It’s not the only good piece of exchange news for crypto assets, as just two
days before Bakkt opened for trading the [CME Group confirmed
](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/cme-expands-bitcoin-
footprint)what had been previously reported in _The Block_ : options on the
exchange group’s bitcoin futures are coming in Q1 2020, pending regulatory
review.

The CME’s contract, launched in December 2017, saw first-day volume of 751
contracts, each representing five bitcoins. Now that contract’s ADV is ~7,000
contracts. Bakkt’s first day saw 73 total contracts trade (72 monthly futures
and one daily future). One key way Bakkt differentiates its offering from the
CME’s bitcoin futures is via the physical delivery mechanism and custodial
element of the contract.

It’s worth noting that derivatives contracts take time to gain traction.
Bakkt’s first days of trading are well in line with another recently launched
contract, Cboe’s AMERIBOR Futures. Like bitcoin, AMERIBOR is challenging an
entrenched financial trading arena — the realm of interest rate benchmarks. It
also can take a while for futures commission merchants to feel comfortable
enough to dive in, [as has been the case with
Bakkt.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-25/banks-on-sidelines-
may-limit-early-bakkt-bitcoin-futures-volume)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*MTL6WW5834FUPMcQ)

Regardless of the initial volume, the launch of deliverable bitcoin futures as
well as the steady traction being gained on regulated exchanges are yet more
positive signs for digital assets. These products are on top of an array of
perpetual swaps, options, and leveraged products in the global crypto trading
realm, but have the benefit of U.S. regulatory oversight. (In fact, it was
acquiring the necessary approvals that delayed the launch of Bakkt, which was
initially planned for November 2018.)

Bakkt’s regulatory approvals and the existence of bitcoin trading on the CME
continue to prove that bitcoin is a viable trading instrument. But more needs
to be done, in part because regulators don’t seem to put much stock in these
developments. In the 24 hours prior to the CME’s bitcoin options announcement,
[SEC Chairman Jay Clayton
said](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/40270/sec-chair-clayton-bitcoin-
needs-to-be-better-regulated-before-it-is-traded-on-major-exchanges) at a
conference that he does not imagine bitcoin trading on a major exchange until
it is “better regulated.” Meanwhile, new CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert said on
CNBC that crypto derivatives product interest is growing, but “demand is far
below [what] we see for other commodity classes.”

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*R9ehDOFJJdasb9-9)

To those points, the fact remains that the CME Group _is_ a major exchange. It
is the largest derivatives exchange on the planet, with a market cap greater
than $75 billion. And while Cboe Global Markets decided to delist its bitcoin
futures earlier this year after brief competition with the CME, it was another
major exchange (at that point bigger than it had ever been, after the
acquisition of BATS in 2017) that was trading bitcoin. Bakkt-parent ICE, which
also owns the NYSE, is, similarly, an exchange giant, with a market cap
greater than $50 billion. Moreover, while not sizable institutions like the
CME, ICE, and Cboe, there are other U.S. domiciled crypto exchanges like
Kraken, Bittrex, Coinbase, and Gemini. Then there are Seed CX and ErisX, both
CMTD investments, that, pending the proper regulatory approvals, will also be
entering the derivatives fray. (ErisX and Seed CX both have their spot markets
up and running.)

All of this means better hedging, and a more welcoming environment for any
institutional participants, market makers, or traditional individual futures
traders who want to get exposure to this emerging asset class, as each trade,
custodial development, use case, and [pizza
purchase](https://qz.com/1285209/bitcoin-pizza-day-2018-eight-years-ago-
someone-bought-two-pizzas-with-bitcoins-now-worth-82-million/) slowly adds to
the crypto puzzle.
