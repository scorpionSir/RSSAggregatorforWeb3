State of the Nation - $MEME, NFTs, and EIP1559

$MEME is the main topic of conversation in this state of the nation. We bring
on Jordan Lyall (@jordanlyall), the accidental founder of $MEME, to help us
understand how MEME accidentally became a thing by memeing itself into
existence.

1) $MEME IS HOT RN

2) WHY EIP1559 ISN'T HERE

3) IS UNI A BUY, HOLD, OR SELL?
