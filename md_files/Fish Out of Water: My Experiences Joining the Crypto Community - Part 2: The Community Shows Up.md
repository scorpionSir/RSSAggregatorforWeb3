Hi everybody! Gabriel Golcher here again! Last we spoke was a couple of months
ago and it is high time for me to touch base with y‚Äôall.

My experiences these first few months have been amazing. For starters, I‚Äôve
learned a lot about the crypto space. For example, in my previous blog post I
shared this tweet as something I did not understand at all:

> A new Gnosis Safe App is live!
>
> Users can now trade ETH and ERC20s straight from their multisig using
> [@1inchexchange](). 1inch achieves the best market rates by splitting orders
> among multiple DEXes in one single transaction. üîíüîÑ
>
> Try it today at[gnosis-safe.io/app](http://gnosis-safe.io/app)
>
> [pic.twitter.com/GAmXomWw4j](https://t.co/GAmXomWw4j)
>
> ‚Äî Gnosis Safe (@gnosisSafe) [Jul 8,
> 2020](https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1280894399782633472)

Today I can proudly say I understand it! üôå I‚Äôve really learned a ton about the
Ethereum platform and many of the technologies that build on top of it.

Second, and more importantly, **I‚Äôve been able to see firsthand how seriously
amazing this community is** through our user research efforts. We undertook
two studies already. The first one is currently ongoing and consists of in-
depth user interviews that will allow us to learn about Ethereum users and
develop user personas. The second one, already completed, helped us test early
design ideas for a part of AKASHA‚Äôs UI using a clickable prototype.

In both, the results have been nothing short of spectacular! For the first
one, we‚Äôve had as of today 44 interviews with 31 different people (it‚Äôs a two-
parter). We‚Äôre estimating we‚Äôll reach around 50 interviews with 35 people all
told.

For the second study, we had over 200 unique people run through our clickable
prototype, with many running through it in both our mobile and desktop
configurations, and thus reaching over 350 results.

The sheer number of you who have generously dedicated your time and effort to
help us is nothing short of unprecedented. üíØ I seriously have never had
participation numbers like that in my professional career (even when
participants were paid!).

I learned early on that this community is enthusiastic, energetic, and
idealistic (in a good way). I have now witnessed for myself how y‚Äôall walk the
walk besides talking the talk. **Thank you!Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è**

Beyond our gratitude, your efforts will be well worth it. Besides helping make
our product better, and thus benefitting the entire Ethereum ecosystem,
**we‚Äôll also be sharing the findings of our in-depth user interviews here**.
We‚Äôll share our analysis and the personas we develop so that you can use them
in your Ethereum-based projects.

One piece of feedback we heard repeatedly during our user interviews is that
the UX of Ethereum projects needs to be better. Thus, I‚Äôd like to contribute
back to the community and **offer to give you UX consultations for your
Ethereum-based projects.** If you have a full-fledged company or project, just
an idea, or something in the middle, I want to help you. Please reach out to
me through the [AKASHA Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JqqKasJ) and we can
set something up.

Thank you all again!
