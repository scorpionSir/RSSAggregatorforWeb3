 **Joe Biden is showing signs of life.**

Just this week, Bernie Sandersâ€™ odds for the Democratic Nomination stood at a
commanding 49c( **!** ) lead over the nearest candidate, Michael Bloomberg. At
that time, Sanders (65c/share) outpaced Biden (13c/share) by 52c.

Weâ€™ve told you before that these markets will be volatile, and that heavy
frontrunners have seen their reigns atop the odds leaderboard crumble in short
order. Well, in intra-week action, Bernie has seen his price drop 21% to
51c/share, while Bidenâ€™s ascended 123% to 29c/share; narrowing Bernieâ€™s lead
to 22c.

Why is Biden all of a sudden making a comeback?
[Keendawg](https://twitter.com/keendawgSSG) of _[Star Spangled
Gamblers](https://starspangledgamblers.com/)_ fame hits us with some knowledge
in a [recent article](https://starspangledgamblers.com/2020/02/25/south-
carolina-is-berning-will-sleepy-joe-awaken/):  

>  _`One of two things is probably going to happen in the Palmetto State: Joe
> Biden will win and get the juice to pick up a handful of Southern states on
> Super Tuesday, maybe get his neck back into the Texas Primary, and re-set
> this campaign as a two-man race with Bernie Sandersâ€¦`_
>
>  _`â€¦If Biden can win South Carolinaâ€¦then lots of markets are going to pump
> in his favor. In fact, some of them already are doing this in anticipation
> of a win.`_

  
Itâ€™s true. This week, Bidenâ€™s odds to win South Carolina (Saturday, 2/29) have
improved from 43c/share all the way to 91c. Keendawg lays out the game theory
that should follow from oneâ€™s belief in how Joe will perform in SC; so that
readers may skate where the puck is going:  

>  _ **`THE OPPORTUNITY`**`  
>  If you believe that Joe Biden is going to win South Carolina, then you also
> need to be thinking about buying into his campaign in similar states like
> Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. As your pro-Joe-Mojo increases and you
> start thinking he might be a winner after all, you should possibly consider
> Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, and Arkansas as reasonable targets. And
> if you are a serious alpha, then you also understand that political machine
> states like New York and Illinois, where big city bosses who have never been
> Bernie Sanders fans can crank-out votes by hook-or-by-crook, are targets of
> opportunity.  
>  
> ` **`THE RISK`**`  
>  If Uncle Joe loses South Carolina, his campaign is over. Thatâ€™s it. Biden
> has been able to claim that Iowa and New Hampshire were road games for him
> and that South Carolina is the first contest on his home turf â€” one where
> there are lots of black voters who are the backbone of his support. If his
> strongest supporters donâ€™t show up for him, then itâ€™s game over and all your
> Biden shares are basically worth zero.`_

### Super Tuesday

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F579b43bd-

bd63-4dc0-870a-a7f3c866923f_862x164.png)

Saturdayâ€™s South Carolina contest serves as the warmup for a wild day on the
campaign trail, Super Tuesday. On March 4th, a total of _**16**_ states and
territories will hold primaries or caucuses; Alabama, American Samoa,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Democrats Abroad, Maine, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and
Virginia.

This day represents roughly 1/3 of total delegates, and thus will be a key
determinant of who will go on to face Donald Trump in the general election.
Our friends at [Guesser](https://guesser.com/) will have the best in Super
Tuesday data, merging real-time PredictIt odds with live election results.

### Contested Convention Watch

In [last weekâ€™s post](https://augur.substack.com/p/augur-weekly-contested-
convention), we detailed the path to a contested convention, and how betting
markets may be overpricing Bernie relative to the probability of a contested
convention. PredictItâ€™s contested convention â€˜Yesâ€™ odds were volatile (on low
volume) falling from 54c/share to 40c/share in one day, before climbing all
the back to their current mark of 56c.

Bernieâ€™s DemNom frontrunner price still seems a little rich relative to the
likelihood of a contested convention, but this is not trading advice.
