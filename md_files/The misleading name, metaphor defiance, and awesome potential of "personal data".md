## The misleading name, metaphor defiance, and awesome potential of "personal
data"

By [Philip Sheldrake](/blog/author/philip-sheldrake/)

·

January 17, 2019

[Read this post on
AKASHA](https://beta.akasha.world/#/0x872f8817ecf68ec4a5f940375a7900f9814da047/0x885ee0f5e5503a711fb47a9ffff5443163ca6188d273a5d592901ce875e92004)

We have a problem and an opportunity currently labelled "personal data".

The opportunity encompasses nothing less than a complete redesign of our lives
and societies and our collective ability to grapple with complex adaptive
systems including [super-wicked
problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem#Super_wicked_problems)
— but this will remain elusive until we've wrestled with the "personal data"
problem, including the problem of the way we frame the opportunity and
problem.

While we needed the General Data Protection Regulation
([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)) to
stop some very disrespectful and frankly unethical and harmful practices
relating to personal data, no regulation can require innovation. The
innovation, indeed transformation, I'm talking about here is in the spirit if
not the letter of the regulation. Perhaps the most prominent and simplest
explanation for why it cannot be to the letter is contained in the
Regulation's first definition ([Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/))
by which "an identified or identifiable natural person" is thereafter known as
a "data subject", which is entirely the wrong framing for the kind of
innovation I envisage.

This topic is core to my work and this post serves two purposes. First,
selfishly, it's a way to communicate efficiently without having to repeat the
contents on a weekly basis. Second, I hope to identify more like and dislike
minds in seeking the collective intelligence needed to explore the bountiful
and indeed existentially-critical opportunity sooner than later.

I do have some ambition for brevity here, so don't expect a full thesis on the
topic but rather an outline with some decent signposts. The brevity I did
manage still better suited a series of three posts. This is the first of the
three.

* * *

The early Internet and Web communities entertained some big dreams —
democratized access to information, a more inclusive and just world, and so
healthier and happier citizens. We were simply to slough off the old ways and
resign the previous 'order' to history.

But it hasn’t worked out like that. So far.

Rather, we have disinformation rebranded “fake news”, deep privacy invasions
by both state and industry, and a growing hegemonic concentration of digital
products and services, and — most vitally — of data.

And just a few weeks ago we got [another
reminder](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-46463029) that our
politicians still obsess with the false dichotomy of security versus privacy,
and do so with sufficient stupidity to believe the laws of their country
superior to the laws of mathematics. Good luck with that.

Joking aside, their efforts undermine the very societal qualities they believe
they're defending. A very different approach is required.

I research and help engineer the development and application of
cryptonetworking with a focus on so-called personal data. The goal is
individual empowerment and, concurrently, encouraging the emergence of
collective intelligence. I'm fortunate to be doing so under the auspices of
the [AKASHA Foundation](https://akasha.org/), the [Digital Life
Collective](https://diglife.com/), and Southampton University's [School of
Electronics and Computer Science](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/).

## The "personal data" problem

Simply speaking, the problem is this ... the I and the we are not really
separable.

Stereotypically, the Weltanschauung of Western cultures emphasises
individuality, perhaps most naively
[personified](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2012-spring/individualism-
collectivism/) by Ayn Rand adherents. From a different perspective, Professor
Luciano Floridi seeks to understand the informational nature of personal
identity, exploring three levels of individuating detachment:

> ... selves emerge as the last step in a process of detachment from reality
> that begins with a corporeal membrane encapsulating an organism, proceeds
> through a cognitive membrane encapsulating an intelligent animal, and
> concludes with a consciousness membrane encapsulating a mental self or
> simply a mind.
>
> ... The self emerges as a break with nature, not as a super connection with
> it.
>
> [Professor Luciano
> Floridi](https://www.academia.edu/9352388/The_Informational_Nature_of_Personal_Identity)

Equally stereotypically, some Eastern cultures are attributed with giving the
collectivity primacy. I'm guessing most people who might read my stuff will be
immersed in individualistic culture, so here are just three alternative
perspectives.

> On my interpretation, for the Confucians there are only interrelated
> persons, no individual selves.
>
> … By emphasizing our sociality, the Confucians simultaneously emphasize our
> relationality: an abstract individual I am not, but rather … a particular
> son, husband, father, grandfather, teacher, student, colleagues, neighbor,
> friend, and more. In all of these roles I am defined in large measure by the
> other(s) with whom I interact, highly specific personages related to me in
> one way or another; they are not abstract autonomous individuals either.
> Moreover, we do not “play” these roles, as we tend to speak of them, but
> rather live our roles, and when all of them have been specified, and their
> interrelationships made manifest, then we have, for Confucius, been
> thoroughly individuated, but with nothing left over with which to piece
> together an autonomous individual self. Being thus the aggregate sum of the
> roles I live, it must follow that as I grow older my roles will change, and
> consequently I become quite literally a different person.
>

Going even further east geographically speaking, here's a personal reflection:

> I am not an individual; I am an integral part of the cosmos. I share
> divinity with my ancestors, the land, the seas and the skies. I am not an
> individual, because I share a tofi (inheritance) with my family, my village
> and my nation. I belong to my family and my family belongs to me. I belong

And to mix it up a bit more, a South American:

> Our original guiding stars are struggle and hope. But there is no such thing
> as a lone struggle, no such thing as a lone hope. In every human being are
> combined the most distant epochs, passivity, mistakes, sufferings, the

To my mind, neither the individual nor the collectivity can _be_ nor _become_
without the other, in which case we need to take a look at the language here
in preparing the ground for thinking about "personal data".

The establishment of [gender-neutral
pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-
person_pronoun#Historical_and_dialectal_gender-neutral_pronouns) across many
languages is well underway for the simple reason that binary conceptions of
gender do not represent the world, as anyone with a rudimentary grasp of
complexity can appreciate. Similarly, the number-based _singular_ and _plural_
forms serve to reinforce a conceptualisation of the world as consisting of
parts and wholes. This has practical quotidian application of course but falls
short in accommodating situations demanding sense-making of and action-taking
within complex adaptive systems.

It's recognising and in fact celebrating such complexity that led me to a
biologically inspired term for exploring the regenerative interweave of the
digital fabric — the [Internetome](http://internetome.org/).

Comprehending complexity requires some shifts in thinking. For me, these
include:

  * Away from the reductionism of 'parts and wholes' towards the simultaneity of a thing being both a part and a whole (holonic philosophy), and perhaps then to an [implicate order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicate_and_explicate_order) — a sort of holism beyond the scope of this post
  * Away from a focus on the agents (nodes, things, groups) towards a focus on the relationships (the edges, dynamics, liminality, interdependencies), per [Actor-Network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory) and ultimately to [agencement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assemblage_\(philosophy\)) — the continuous flux of assembling and reassembling.

Perhaps we need a number-neutral pronoun in the context of complex systems and
I sometimes invoke _Wei_ – a portmanteau of _we_ and _I_ that I pronounce
_way_. I'm not writing this, wei is — concurrently _I_ in the context of _we_
and _we_ in the context of _I_ ; neither singular nor plural.

For every hyperlinked acknowledgement in this post there are a thousand
conversations and shared insights that are being channeled right here, right
now, that are simply impossible to tease apart let alone reference
individually. I strongly suspect that the vast majority of "original thinking"
originates in the _wei_ not the _I_.

—— For readability, I will revert to _I_. ——

Similarly, [I have
concluded](https://www.philipsheldrake.com/2018/02/decentralization-needs-
more-than-cryptonetworks-internetome/#ourtech) that the response to the
current and deeply unhealthy dominance of _their_ tech (think Facebook,
Google, and their Chinese counterparts) is not _my_ tech but _ourtech_ — a
[self-sovereignty](https://www.philipsheldrake.com/2016/05/defining-sovereign-
technology-can-build-know-see/) where the "self" in question refers to various
wei not just I, and where the combining (agencement) of humans and
technologies is indivisible (hence the elision of our and tech).

Our world needs neologisms, as indeed it always has. Nevertheless, you will
probably agree that offering up a new pronoun to technologists and lawmakers
isn't going to form the basis for the most effective communication!
Fortunately, following a conversation with my colleague [Mihai
Alisie](https://akasha.org/blog/author/mihai-alisie/), I think we can make a
functionally-similar point in the specific context here with more readily
understood language.

It turns out that there is very few data that may be described as purely
_personal_ data. That lunch date, that genome map, those photos, that joint
bank account — all turn out to be **interpersonal data**. In fact, a personal
bank account also records the relationship between two parties / persons (the
bank and its customer), and lists transactions between the account owner and
other parties / persons.

The prefix _inter_ is familiar and requires an apparently simple shift in
locus, and yet deeper down it offers a way forward to engineer the complexity
needed to respond to the complexity (per the [law of requisite
variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_\(cybernetics\)#Law_of_Requisite_Variety)).

Maintaining the word _person_ just about stretches to our needs in terms of
[personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood), encompassing legal
persons (organizations recognized as having privileges and obligations under
law) and quite reasonably
[transhumans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism). To press the point
home fully however, any organizing (assemblage, however ephemeral or enduring)
would also need to be a person.

  * I am a person
  * Alphabet Inc. is a person, as are its subsidiaries, e.g. Google
  * Her Majesty's Government is a person, as are its Departments
  * A family is a person of persons
  * [Molly Millions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Millions) is a person
  * [Hawking Incorporated](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo3750667.html) was a person.

Now let's consider persons living — i.e. relating, interdepending, responding,
learning. In other words, exchanging information, where the [information is a
difference that makes a
difference](https://faculty.washington.edu/jernel/521/Form.htm). We're now in
the realm of interpersonal data.

Before progressing to the problems propagated today by the very ways we frame
the problem and opportunity of personal data, one final observation here —
data has no scale.

Sociologists reflect on the agent (individual) and the structure (society).
Computer scientists think in terms of client (individual device) and server
(including its agglomeration as "the cloud"). And yet such duality is akin to
insisting a fractal be viewed at no more than two discrete scales. Nature
doesn't work like this, and:

> If one way be better than another, that you may be sure is Nature's way.
>
> Aristotle

We are then contemplating interpersonal data with no scale at every scale.

## The problem of the way we frame the opportunity and problem

Our first forays in the digital world are, naturally, informed by prior
experience and knowledge. We moved from mail to email, from files and folders
to files and folders, from desktops to desktops, etc. Only much later does it
occur to us that digital has unprecedented qualities — e.g. that search and
discovery is preferable to filing, and new forms of communication may just
beat email.

As noted above, language helps and constrains us. Language is metaphor, and
our metaphors predate the innovation we attempt to describe and shape with our
language. When it comes to personal data, this really isn't working out well
for us, and in aspiring to head off the potential disastrous consequences Tony
Fish [notes](http://www.mydigitalfootprint.com/2019/01/data-is-data-it-is-not-
oil-or-gold-or.html):

> Data is data.

i.e. It is not like anything else. And I couldn't put it better myself. Yet
here's what we're up against: data-as-property, data-as-labour, data-as-
reputation, data-as-public-good, data-as-me.

In [the second post in this series of
three](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/21/interpersonal-data-2-of-3), I
explore the dominant conceptualization of personal data, that is as property,
explaining why it is a woefully inadequate approach, and review the less well-
known data-as-labour framing.
