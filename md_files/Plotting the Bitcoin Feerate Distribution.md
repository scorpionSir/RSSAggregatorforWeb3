##  Plotting the Bitcoin Feerate Distribution

#####

Sunday, March 18, 2018

How did the median Bitcoin feerate evolve [from 2013 to
2015?](https://transactionfee.info/charts/feerate/median?avg=7&step=false&start=2013-01-01&end=2015-01-01)
When were the [feerate spikes in
2017?](https://transactionfee.info/charts/feerate/percentiles?avg=7&step=false&start=2017-01-01&end=2018-01-01)
Visualizing the Bitcoin feerate distribution per block was on my todo list
since I've started working on the first version of my [mempool.observer
project](/projects/mempool-observer-2017-version/) in mid-2017. But acquiring
the data wasn't as easy as I first thought.

Update January 2020: The feerate chart have are not included the 2020 version
of transactionfee.info so some links in this post might be broken.

In this post, I describe my unsuccessful approaches and explain my final
solution. I'll go into beginner to intermediate technical stuff on Bitcoin. I
hope this post might help people who are just starting out on small Bitcoin
projects (i.e. me a few months ago).

distribution/header.png) feerate distribution over time

#### Motivation

Our site [transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info) lets a user check
the fee efficiency of a bitcoin transaction they've send or received. Besides
SegWit and output batching we wanted to provide an indicator when a service
drastically overpays the feerate. We needed data on the feerate distribution
per block to determine what a low, but reasonable feerate would have been to
be included in the same block. David Harding
[suggested](https://twitter.com/hrdng/status/955489792141287429) plotting the
feerate across ten-percentile intervals to see which percentile is suitable.

#### Querying feerate data over the RPC interface

My first idea was to query each block over the Bitcoin Core RPC interface. The
query [getblock _blockhash_ 2](https://bitcoin-rpc.github.io/getblock.html)
returns the corresponding block with all its transactions as JSON. For the
feerate distribution per block, I'd need to iterate over each transaction and
calculate its feerate. The feerate is specified as the transaction fee divided
by the transaction vsize $$(2)$$. The fee is the sum of all input amounts
deducted by the sum of all output amounts $$(1)$$.

`fee = sum(input amounts) - sum(output amounts)`  
`feerate = fee / vsize`

However, querying each block with its transactions is not enough. An input
only references a previous transaction output (TXO). It doesn't contain the
actual input amount. This can be solved by simply querying the TXO. RPC-call
batching brings huge performance improvements here.

I coded a small python script and used a local testnet node to generate a
first data set. Everything worked fine and I quickly had a basic chart setup
to share my initial proof of concept. However, I didn't think about the
`testnet` versus `mainnet` performance of that script. Since blocks on mainnet
contain more transactions and more inputs per transaction the script ran ages
querying data from my HDD. I eventually stopped it and started looking for
alternative approaches.

#### Alternatives

##### Reading the raw .dat files

I looked at multiple blk*.dat-file parsers to build a TXO-index for quicker
lookups. This turned out to be a dead end. I wanted to automatically update
the data every few hours on a small VPS, but the output of the index would
probably have been more than a hundred gigabytes. This was not an option for
me.

##### Google's BigQuery Bitcoin Blockchain data set

When I stumbled over [Google's BigQuery Bitcoin Blockchain data
set](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/02/bitcoin-in-bigquery-
blockchain-analytics-on-public-data) I thought this would solve all my data
problems, but was quickly disappointed with the limited data that's available.
I miss the reference to the TXO in the input table. The data set might be well
suited for other projects and one plus point definitely is the ten-minute
update interval, but I, at least for this project, have no use for it.

##### BlockSci

Then I found out about [BlockSci](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci): "A high-
performance tool for blockchain science and exploration". It seems to do
exactly what I wanted to do. At the time I looked into it, it didn't use the
`vsize` for feerate calculation. This would have resulted in an incorrect
feerate for SegWit transactions. However, a few days ago v0.4.0 was released
which [uses the `vsize` for feerate
calculations](https://github.com/citp/BlockSci/issues/43). If you are
interested in working with data from the bitcoin blockchain I can highly
recommend taking a look at their
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02489.pdf).

#### Patching Bitcoin Core and -reindexing

As a final solution, I included a simple LogPrintf in validation.cpp of
Bitcoin Core. I print an identifier to grep for followed by the block height
and the feerate for each non-coinbase transaction into the debug.log separated
by a comma. The [patch
diff](https://github.com/0xB10C/bitcoin/commit/6b2ef276ceeec7f1cf64f84b5d1cd9d5be9e6d10)
is only a few lines. After compiling and a full `-reindex` of the blockchain
my debug.log contained all blocks with the feerate of each transaction.
Grepping the blocks from the debug.log leaves me with about a gigabyte of raw
data (around 100MB gziped).

distribution/feerate.png) log-file with the feerates for the transactions in
block 510851

#### Using the dataset

I have a pruned node running on a small VPS and insert the percentile data
into a database. I then automatically generate the .csv-files which are
displayed on
[transactionfee.info/charts](https://transactionfee.info/charts?chart=feerateDetailed&rollavg=7).
In my next step, I'll connect the database to an indicator on
[transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info/).

I guess I'll be using the raw data to experiment a bit with Gnuplot in the
future. I have a neat idea for that. And retrospectively rating feerate
estimation algorithms might be an idea, too. Feel free to [contact
me](https://b10c.me/about/) if you are interested in the data set.

#### A List of Public Bitcoin Feerate Estimation APIs

My search for a list of public Bitcoin feerate estimation APIs ended without
any real results. [Jameson Lopp](https://twitter.com/lopp) has a section on
feerate estimators on his [bitcoin.page](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-
information/fee-estimates.html) and [Antoine Le
Calvez's](https://twitter.com/khannib) dashboard
[txstats.com](https://txstats.com/dashboard/db/fee-estimation) provides a
visualization of different estimation APIs. But that is not what I was looking
for. That's why I compiled this list.

#### The 300 MB default maxmempool Problem

Unconfirmed transactions are quite a hassle for bitcoin users. I recently came
across an interesting problem which is not the usual "my transaction is stuck"
problem.
