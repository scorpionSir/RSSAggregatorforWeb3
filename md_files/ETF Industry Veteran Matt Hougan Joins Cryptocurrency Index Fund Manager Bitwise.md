#  **ETF Industry Veteran Matt Hougan Joins Cryptocurrency Index Fund Manager
Bitwise**

 ** _The Bitwise HOLD 10 Index Fund substantially outperforms Bitcoin in First
Two Months Since Launch_**

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20, 2018 — Bitwise Asset Management, manager of the first
cryptocurrency index fund, the [Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index
Fund](https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/fund), announced today that ETF
industry veteran Matt Hougan is joining the firm as Vice President of Research
& Development.

Matt Hougan joins Bitwise as Vice President, Head of Research & Development.

Hougan was previously CEO of Inside ETFs, the world’s leading ETF education
company, and before that, CEO of ETF.com, creator of the world’s first
institutionally oriented, ETF-specific ratings and analytics service. He is a
three-time member of the Barron’s ETF Roundtable and co-author of the CFA
Institute’s monograph on ETFs, “A Comprehensive Guide to Exchange-Traded
Funds.”

“It’s incredibly exciting to have a leader like Matt Hougan joining the
exceptional team at Bitwise,” said Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain
Capital, an investor in Bitwise. “As cryptoassets come into the mainstream,
investors increasingly want access to rules-based beta options. Matt’s
expertise in indexing, exchange-traded products, and institutional research
complements the team’s expertise in software, and will help Bitwise continue
to be a best-in-class partner to investors.”

Matt joins Bitwise on the heels of the launch of its first fund late last
fall. The Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund holds the 10 largest
cryptoassets, currently capturing around 80% of the market. In its first two
full months since launch, the HOLD 10 substantially outperformed a
concentrated investment in Bitcoin alone, delivering a 45% return versus 1.7%
return for Bitcoin. That outperformance persisted across both bull and bear
markets: In December’s bull market, Bitcoin was up 39% compared with 78% for
the HOLD 10, while January’s bear market saw Bitcoin fall 27% compared with
18% for the fund.

“Having the opportunity to participate in the development of a potentially
massive new platform or technology is rare,” said Hougan. “Bitwise is taking
the right approach to the market, and I’m incredibly excited to join them as
they navigate this rapidly growing space. The Bitwise team is extremely
thoughtful, high-integrity and technologically oriented, and we have a unique
opportunity to build a meaningful institution in the coming years.”

“Matt is an incredible resource and will play a key role in our mission to
support crypto investors with high-quality, institutionally oriented
investment products,” said Hunter Horsley, Bitwise’s CEO. “We look forward to
working with him as we expand our offerings and capabilities in the years to
come.”

[Bitwise Asset Management](https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/) is backed by
leading institutional and individual investors including Khosla Ventures,
General Catalyst, Blockchain Capital, Naval Ravikant, David Sacks, Elad Gil,
Adam Nash, Adam Ludwin, Suna Said, Avichal Garg, and others.

concentration limits, and compliance. The portfolio is rebalanced monthly.

several liquidity providers to obtain good prices. Additionally, the manager
capitalizes on technical opportunities to generate extra return such as hard
forks, airdrops, and staking.
