March 23th, 2020

There are three asset "superclasses"  
\- Store of Value  
\- Capital Asset  
\- Commodity Asset

Join Ryan and David as they explore the boundaries between asset types, and
discover where Ether lies in relation to these three classes.

Additionally, Ryan and David compare and contrast the economic and financial
institutions that make up the world we know, and how they relate to these
three classifications.
