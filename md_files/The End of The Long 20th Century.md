##  **Foreword**

I wrote the first draft of this essay on March 13th, 2020 when it seemed the
world is doomed because it cannot appropriately respond to a rapidly growing
global pandemic.

Since writing the first draft governments globally have resorted to more
appropriate measures. Still, the damage has been done and the world will start
[realizing
losses](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1240991979535728641?s=20) in the
coming weeks and months. I fear that the worst is yet to come.

After I explain how we have arrived at a point of being unable to deal with
known knowns, I am offering two alternative visions for the post-2020 world.
One is a world of pain and renaissance, the other is a world where by the end
of the year we will party like it's '98.

##  **Introduction**

We are facing a crisis of our lifetimes. Learning through pain is useful. In
months and years to come we can learn to turn painful lessons into
information. In the ruin one can rediscover wisdom.

The world has become fragile. Do not trick yourself thinking this is a chance
event. We have become vulnerable and there is a reason for it.

By the late modernity we have accumulated too much knowledge for one
individual to understand. Human knowledge has become unmanageably vast, as
captured almost hundred years ago by Will Durant in _**The Story of
Philosophy**_ :

>  _Perspective was lost. ‚ÄúFacts‚Äù replaced understanding; and knowledge, split
> into a thousand isolated fragments, no longer generating wisdom.  _
>
>  _The gap between life and knowledge grew wider and wider; those who
> governed could not understand those who thought, and those who wanted to
> know could not understand those who knew..._
>
>  _For if knowledge became too great for communication, it would degenerate
> into scholasticism, and the weak acceptance of authority; mankind would slip
> into a new age of faith...and civilisation, which had hoped to raise itself
> upon education disseminated far and wide, would be left precariously based
> upon a technical erudition that had become monopoly of an esoteric class
> monastically isolated from the world by the high birth rate of terminology._

Think about the Lindy effect; the "new replaced by newer" phenomenon. Human
problems age in reverse - old problems will persist, new problems will be
replaced by newer problems. Through such lense human progress is a mirage. The
old problem of human history is a tendency to fool ourselves into thinking
that we _know things_.

##  **The illusion of stability**

Ancient philosophers knew little of the world but the accuracy of some of
their [hypotheses in mechanics and astronomy is
astonishing](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Hypothesis-Ancient-Natural-
Philosophy/dp/110765761X). They made remarkable deductions with limited data.
Today, we have lots of data but make astonishingly wrong inductions. As
pointed out by Nassim Taleb:

>  _More data is an optionality on the part of the researcher, which means
> that the researcher gets the upside and truth gets the downside_.

The experts and specialists put on blinders. Thus, we have arrived at ‚Äú[expert
modellers](https://twitter.com/borisjohnson/status/1237760976482598913?s=21)‚Äù
risking the lives of millions. Or in other words: non-risk takers taking risks
with the skin of others¬π. As Taleb pointed out:

>  _Education makes the wise slightly wiser, but it makes[the
> fool](https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1241003952935768064?s=20) vastly
> more dangerous._

Our modern civilisation puts theory above practice. Probably by chance, almost
a century ago, Durant described Ancient Greece's and modern inclination to
theorise:

>  _Greek mind was not disciplined...and ran too readily to theories and
> conclusions. So Greek philosophy leaped to heights unreached again, while
> Greek science limped behind. Our modern danger is precisely opposite;
> inductive data fall upon us from all sides...we suffocate with uncoordinated
> facts; our minds are overwhelmed with science breeding and multiplying in
> specialistic chaos for want of synthetic thought and a unifying philosophy.
> We are all mere fragments of what a man might be.  _

We have sacrificed wisdom for _the illusion of stability_ , relying on what we
named "knowledge", stewarded by the "experts" whose claims can only be
inspected by their peers.

There seems to be a trade-off between the illusion of stability and the truth.
Humans can be astonishingly wrong for a long period of time, but as we are all
collectively wrong, we find illusory stability in such collective illusion.
Eventually, a comfortable and convenient illusion gets confronted by reality¬≤.

We have converged on untruths as foundations for the contemporary world.
‚ÄúTruth‚Äù is that the world is a dynamic and ever-changing chaos ruled by
uncertainty (potential loss, pain, death and suffering) that can only be tamed
by continual practicing and tinkering. That requires being often wrong (when
it is cheap).

The institutions stewarding the knowledge incentivize the opposite: one must
be often right. Thus, we were led to the greatest contemporary error -
painting an image of a static world. Because being often right requires the
world to be seen as still.

This could explain a hypothesis of _the great stagnation_[since the
1970s](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/) (e.g. [Peter Thiel is a
proponent)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s). Being unable to let
go of the illusion, our society has become radically unfree. As a result; the
academia, governance innovations and technology (in the world of atoms) have
stagnated or even deteriorated in recent decades.

Taleb explains that ‚Äú _freedom is never free_ ‚Äù and that ‚Äú _you're only as
free as your last trade_ ‚Äù. In a sense, our last big trade included an effort
to build the illusion and we have to keep investing to prop it up. What
matters most is that the illusion keeps standing¬≥. But this comes at a cost.

>  _What matters isn't what a person has or doesn't have; it is what he or she
> is afraid of losing_.

We are unfree in letting go of the stability bubble. We have confused
stability with lack of variance and volatility. Slaves to _theories,_ we have
been sacrificing our ability to invent things and generate wisdom. These
require optionality and tinkering - [things that create and benefit from
volatility](https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1240931755936210945?s=20).

Today, we are willing to take the wrong risks. This demonstrates that we have
built an increasing capacity to fool ourselves into thinking we can predict
things and " _make models"_. These models work until they stop‚Å¥ (see chart
below).

##  **Triumph of knowledge over radical evil**

Lately I think about Nietzsche, the philosopher that is yet to be understood:

>  _The mankind surely does not represent an evolution toward a better or
> stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This "progress" is
> merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea._

Perhaps the most useful reading of Nietzsche has been revealed to me in
[Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-
Incerto/dp/0812979680):

>  _Culture has been increasingly building blindness to the mysterious, the
> impenetrable, what Nietzsche called the Dionysian, in life._

This is a reference to ‚Äútruth‚Äù in contrast to ‚Äústability‚Äù. The Dionysian is
the truth about uncertainty - the inevitability of movement and chaos.
Stability is represented by the Apollonian. Nassim Taleb explains that
Nietzsche

>  _‚Ä¶sees two forces, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. One is measured,
> balanced, rational, imbued with reason and self-restraint; the other is
> dark, visceral, wild, untamed, hard to understand, emerging from the inner
> layers of our selves._

In our times, the Dionysian has been tamed. We have amassed excessive
knowledge but we did not practice the ‚Äúdark, visceral, wild, untamed..‚Äù
(volatility), no longer able to synthesise knowledge, as Taleb remarked:

>  _‚Ä¶it hit me that Nietzsche understood something that I did not find
> explicitly stated in his work: that growth in knowledge‚Äîor in
> anything‚Äîcannot proceed without the Dionysian._

Apollonian becomes exposed in times of crisis, which are in a sense our
moments of clarity. But people are struggling to make sense of this and,
perhaps, they will overreact with "more Apollonian". My hope is that
eventually, tamed by the ‚Äústability‚Äù narrative for too long, the Dionysian
will be allowed to thrive alongside the Apollonian‚Åµ.

Not everyone has yet seen the Dionysian within themselves. Necessity is a
mother of invention and I wish that we will be offered an opportunity to
reinvent ourselves while witnessing the Apollonian fail.

The long 20th century seems to be at an end. The Dyonisian embraces _amor
fati._ The fighting spirit will prevail as the courage can only be found in
battle.

I do not dare to write words of guidance on how to face the crisis. But I'd
like to share different perspectives from three different thinkers. These, I
take to heart.

Peter Thiel calls for renaissance so that we can go "[back to the
future](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/03/back-to-the-future)":

>  _Not only do our actions matter, I believe they matter eternally. If we do
> not find a way to take the narrow and moderate path, then we may find out
> that stagnation and decadence were all that kept immoderate men from
> stumbling into the apocalypse._

Friedrich Nietzsche describes the ruthlessness of life, a condition of
improvement, and one's ability to find resolve:

>  _The poison by which the weaker nature is destroyed is strengthening to the
> strong individual - and he does not call it poison._

Finally, I cannot find greater refuge than the work of
[Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Deluxe-Randomness-Procrustes-
Antifragile/dp/198481981X) by Nassim Taleb. Somehow, it brings this
unexplainable calm as I am making sense of what has been unfolding in front of
us. The meta-advice I have chosen to follow is to become someone:

>  _...who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into
> initiation, and desire into undertaking._

##  **How seeming becomes being**

There might be a less dramatic ending to this crisis. I suppose that the
illusion is too powerful. A crisis, such as the financial one in 2008,
represents a moment of clarity. But if the collective prefers the insanity and
converges on the illusion, the reality check can be (temporarily) overcome.
People addicted to the Apollonian seem to be happy renouncing freedom in
exchange for comfort.

Central banks may be playing _catch me if you can_ , but the fact is that no
one really _wants_ to catch them (except for the defiant minority). Some
expect the system to collapse onto itself. Perhaps we only underestimate our
capacity for mass illusion.

Maybe the protagonists have trained themselves to become master illusionists
and the rest is happy with being an obedient audience. It is possible that we
end up, once again, cheering the emperor's new clothes.

Ironically, Western Civilization pride themselves in being different to China
but underneath the individualistic facade we depend on the narrative dictated
by our institutions. At least China is free in their unfreedom. We're unfree
in our "freedom".

I would not discount the possibility of " _the bull market of the century_ "
by the end of 2020. The same way losses will disappear in the alchemy of
balance sheets, bodies (literally) will be buried, and the events of the
spring of 2020 will be forgotten. By winter time, the football game will be on
TV and the turkey in the oven.

This would not be the first time that the West arrived at an impasse, a
structural deadlock, and found a way around it. In _[Straussian
Moment](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-
ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-
ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay\)Thiel)_ ,
Peter Thiel describes how enlightenment had become a new platform for
stability after years of religious warfare in Europe as

> " _the enlightenment undertook a major strategic retreat...The question of
> human nature was abandoned because it is too perilous a question to
> debate._.. _Science of economics and the practice of capitalism filled the
> vacuum._ "

Enlightenment strategically rules out the big questions of human nature,
reducing human to homo economicus, and his desires to _desire to power_.
Science bases its dogma on the predictability of our world and attempted to
fill the void by reengineering God‚Å∂.

One could think of Enlightenment as a cheat code. Cheat codes can take out the
thrill and fun out of the game, probably will not make you great at it, but
they help you win comfortably. In a world where the "thrill and fun" is actual
suffering and death, resorting to a cheat code is understandable.

If we are truly coming at a new impasse we will attempt to use these cheat
codes. Perhaps, the Modern Monetary Theory becomes the new Enlightenment,
strategically ruling out some questions out of order.

Fundamentally, the world can make much less sense, but we will unite in this
illusion. " _Virtual Reality_ " gets a truly new meaning and indeed‚Å∑.

[Eric Weinstein proposed that our world operates like pro
wrestling](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783), internally referred to
as Kayfabe, hinting at our preference of deception over true information.

>  _Because professional wrestling is a simulated sport, all competitors who
> face each other in the ring are actually close collaborators who must form a
> closed system (called "a promotion") sealed against outsiders..._
>
>  _What makes Kayfabe remarkable is that it gives us potentially the most
> complete example of the general process by which a wide class of important
> endeavors transition from failed reality to successful fakery._

Betting on this scenario is betting against common sense. However, looking at
the decades of illusions, I would not underestimate our ability to paint black
swans white (the actual pandemic cannot be considered a black swan). The
society can unite in scapegoating those who have dared to rain on our parade.

##  **Conclusion: The caution of free spirits**

Since the financial crisis of 2008 the market view seems to be bifurcated into
permabears and permabulls. From the perspective of 2020, the events of this
year are a culmination of this tension. _Permabubble_ is an option. But there
is an opportunity to break free.

There are two alternate futures ahead. One that revisits the skin-in-the-game,
artisanal, decentralized, localist way of life and the other is a crony-
capitalist, globalist, over-optimized, centralized and winner-takes-all modus
operandi.

The longer the illusion of stability lives on, the greater the polarization
and more dire the consequences‚Å∏. I am undecided whether by the end of 2020 the
over-optimization and centralization trend will accelerate with Facebook
_consolidating_ travel industry and Amazon local Mom-and-Pops stores, or we
will grow wiser - decentralizing and _antifragilizing_ our world.

I would like to contribute to the former - a world of _free spirits_. However,
I do not wish the pain of ruin onto anyone. In my moments of naivet√© I
imagined the end of the illusion bubble as a "beautiful deleveraging".

I do not think that the possibilities are binary, rather a spectrum between
the two opposites I have described. It is likely that the situation will not
be resolved. The outer world will turn more Apollonian, misunderstanding the
fundamental causes of our failure united against the free spirits.

But (I hope) the _dark side_ , the Dyonisian, will grow stronger in numbers. A
silent resistance will be preparing and patiently waiting for the system to
collapse onto itself, ready to save people from the ruins.

####  **Footnotes**

 **[1]** I find it alarming that even after governments have resorted, [some
academics have argued](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-
making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-
reliable-
data/?fbclid=IwAR1ZKVwCM_Lw3kTckEykirZapHTF2pSfg0Qpspwbb8hjO53n_rxPdFWVQX0)
that there is not enough data to justify such precautions. This is an example
of academics arguing "to start taking the temperature when the house is on
fire or putting the seat belt after the accident". More elaborate rebuttal
[here](https://www.researchers.one/article/2020-03-10).

 **[2]** To give you an idea, without going into details about each of these
examples; 1789, 1914, 1939, 2001, 2008.

 **[3]** Eric Weinstein proposes that there exists semi-organized guardians of
this illusion naming them "The
[DISC](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/The_Distributed_Idea_Suppression_Complex_\(The_DISC\))".

 **[4]** We are [fooled by fat
tails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s45E8_jkyJc&feature=youtu.be); living

stability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4etY_XuQB9A&feature=youtu.be)
(center) with the contribution of rare events away from the center becoming
more significant to the total property of the system. The fatter the fat tail
the more _normal times_ and the more pronounced the consequences of the tail.
This allows one to believe a wrong theory for a long time thinking that one is
right until _the consequences of the tail catch up with one_.

 **[5]** As [@fiskantes](https://twitter.com/Fiskantes) pointed out, the
Dionysian was forced to live underground, projecting itself in the dark
internet memes, sexual kinks, subculture of fantasy, violent video games and
movies. [Thiel
argues](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-

that in the last fifty years there has been a shift from exteriority (doing
things the world) to the interior world. As a result we had ended up with a
super inward-facing culture manifested in drug counterculture, video games,
meditation etc. Perhaps our inability to _do the Dionysian_ in the outer world
led to this shift to interiority.

founding role of violence caused by human mimesis and therefore a systematic
underestimation of the scope of apocalyptic violence."_ Thiel citing Schmitt:
_Men who allow themselves to be deceived by him see only the fabulous effect,
nature seems to be overcome, the age of security dawns; everything has been
taken care of, a clever foresight and planning replace Providence."_

_"A representation of reality might appear to replace reality: instead of
violent wars, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of
serious thought, there could ‚Äúintrigues of all sorts‚Äù, as in a soap opera. It
is a world where people spend their lives amusing themselves to death."_
