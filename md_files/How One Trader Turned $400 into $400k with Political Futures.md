## $400 to $400k

No, that’s not a typo.

As we enter the home stretch of the 2020 General Election, it is a good time
to study the techniques of some of the most prolific political traders.

In pursuit of that endeavor, the **[Political Trade
Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-political-trade)** (PTP) has our
back. The new audio show from [Luckbox Magazine](https://luckboxmagazine.com/)
and [TastyTrade](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/) sits down with some of the
more public-facing political traders to glean insights on their strategies.

In the past few weeks, the PTP spoke on several occasions with [Derek
Phillips](https://twitter.com/DmpFromPI), a PredictIt trader who has more than
100x’d his initial deposit:

  *  **[He Turned $400 into $400,000 (#05)](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-political-trade/e/67968362) **_Mar 11_

  *  **[3 for 3—So Make That $403,000 (#06)](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-political-trade) **_Mar 17_

Here at Augur Weekly, we’ve distilled the highlights of the strategy and
tactics Phillips reveals in the episodes.

* * *

#### Penny Flipping

Phillips deploys an HFT-like strategy of eeking out a high volume of small
wins by capitalizing on other traders’ impatience

> #####  _I find high volume markets...(like the) Democratic Nominee market or
> the 2020 Presidential  
>  
>  Winner market…and what I’m doing is I’m just getting in line at the ‘buy’
> price and waiting my turn  
>  
> until my orders get filled. Then when those orders get filled I just sell
> them for 1c more._

He’ll get as many shares as possible, often maxing PredictIt’s $850 limit per
contract. He’ll then repeat this process as much as 100s of times per day.

> #####  _For a low contract price, 5c, I can sell it for 6c…get 5000 shares
> and make about $50 (in an hour)_

When identifying these markets, Phillips considers a ‘high-volume’ contest to
be one that is big-ticket, or discussed in the news; like the Democratic
Nominee or the General Election. One would also want to identify markets with
stable price outcomes by looking at the order book to see if volume is on the
buy or sell side and the price history to determine the trajectory.

####  
Breaking the ‘iSavage Rule’

In terms of following the ‘ _iSavage Rule_ ’; always selling shares when they
reach 90c per share (named after famed PredictIt trader,
[iSavage](https://twitter.com/iSavage_PI)); Phillips takes the stance that
observance should be more situational than hard-and-fast.

> #####  _There’s always opportunities where you know when a market is (over)
> and if you sell at 90(c),  
>  
>  you’re giving away 10% value…there’s no sense in giving away money like
> that. I even buy at 90  
>  
> sometimes if I feel there’s a better than 90% chance_

####  
Betting Against Things Happening

Otherwise known as ‘laying’ the bet or selling short. Newer traders and
political bettors are typically familiar with ‘backing,’ or betting that
things will happen. With the advent of exchanges where individuals can buy and
sell outcome positions throughout the term of the market, it’s possible to be
net short, and effectively bet against things happening.

Mechanically, this is done by buying ‘`NO`’ or selling ‘`YES`’ in the
particular market that you’d like to bet against. Phillips’ utilization of
this strategy is straightforward enough, buying ‘`NO`’ when he believes
outcomes are overbought.

####  
Social Feature Game Theory

Phillips also mentions the utilization of comment sections and Twitter to
extract sentiment and other information.

> #####  _There is a sort of gamesmanship to what’s going on on the comment
> boards. Some people refer  
>  
>  to it as ‘pumping’…It’s a lot like in poker, for instance, you have people
> bluffing. You have people  
>  
> showing strength in their hand, when in reality they have nothing…Trying to
> manage the  
>  
> personalities on the board and trying to understand what people are
> communicating or  
>  
> suggesting that may or may not be true is one of the big challenges…(I) use
> my personality and  
>  
> use these comments as a means of getting information from other people,
> seeing what other  
>  
> people are thinking about what’s going to happen…understanding what’s
> forming this market…  
>  
> what everybody on the comment board is thinking is going to happen_

####  
Bonus: 3 Trade Recommendations from Derek Phillips

  1. Who will win Oregon Primary? **`Joe Biden`**

  2. Recession in Trump’s 1st Term? **`Yes`**

  3. Party to win Minnesota in 2020? **`Democrats`**
