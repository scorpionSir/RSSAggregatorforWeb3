###  The many traditions of non-governmental money (part i)

The central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve, has put out[
"educational
material"](https://files.stlouisfed.org/research/publications/page1-econ/2018/03/01/bitcoin-
money-or-financial-investment_SE.pdf) on Bitcoin for teachers and students
(including a quiz!). The Bitcoin parts are odd enough, but this and a
subsequent blog post will focus on the following statement: "traditionally,
currency is produced by a nation's government." Is that a fair representation
of monetary traditions? At the very least it is quite incomplete. This two-
part series will proceed back in time, showing some of the many examples non-
governmental money, in order to fill in some of the gaps.  
  
Privately issued IOUs  and privately minted coins are covered here in part (i)
of the series. These IOUs can more specifically be described as bearer
promissory notes, and even more specifically, when issued by banks, bank
notes.  
  
The Bitcoin public blockchain implements a global settlement layer ("layer 1"
in bitcoin parlance).  The closest historical analog to the Bitcoin settlement
layer is not to the bank notes, nor even to the coins (despite its name), it
is to the monetary metal that for most of monetary history from ancient
civilization to the 20th century ultimately underlay the IOUs. This "metal
layer" of historical money systems will be  covered in part (ii) of this
series, as will some even more ancient forms of non-governmental money.  
  

###  _Bank notes_

  
Higher layers of the bitcoin ecosystem, which can include exchanges
(centralized or decentralized) as well as more trust-minimized systems such as
[Lightning](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf), correspond
most closely in our rough historical analogies to checking accounts (which,
although often counted by economists as part of the money supply, and not
created or managed by governments, will be so familiar to most readers that
they will not be covered in this series) and to private bank notes.  In these
higher layer monetary systems, a more computationally (or for bank notes
physically) efficient medium is substituted for a less efficient medium (for
bank notes, often the underlying metal), usually (as is the case with checking
accounts, bank notes, and centralized bitcoin exchanges alike) at the cost of
increasing trust and thus vulnerability and risk in the system.

Bank note (bearer promissory instrument) issued by the North of Scotland Bank,
1945. Many banks besides central banks have issued bank notes that circulated
as currency.  [George Selgin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Selgin) and
[Lawrence White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_H._White) among others
have done extensive work in [this
area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking). Knowledge of the long
history of non-governmental money was one of the inspirations of the original
invention of trust-minimized cryptocurrency.  This practice continues to this
day in Hong Kong and Scotland.

Stockholms Enskilda Bank note, Sweden, 1876. Critics have said that
decentralized note issue, following the same principles of fractional reserve
and maturity mismatch as central banks, were just as or more prone to runs on
the bank. Defenders have argued that competition between note-issuing banks
formed a peer-to-peer system where banks could redeem competitors' notes,
making it more reliable and robust form of fractional reserve banking than a
central bank run or managed fractional reserve.

Ipswich Bank, a "country" (non-London) bank in England, 1820s (this instance
unissued).  Traditionally country banks, like the Bank of England, redeemed
for specie, i.e. the official coin, which contained a standard weight of
monetary metal (usually in this era silver). After 1833, Bank of England notes
became legal tender which holders of country bank notes had to accept in lieu
of specie.

Boone County Bank note, Lebanon, Indiana 1858.  "During this era the U.S. had
no central bank and paper money was issued by a variety of private banks. Some
was even issued by manufacturing and retail companies. This money was backed
by gold, silver, real estate, stocks, bonds, and a wide variety of other
assets. You can no longer cash them in, but they are now worth often
substantial sums as collectibles...the note designs were more varied and
creative than modern money, and were remarkably free of politicians' faces."

Bank of De Soto note, De Soto, Nebraska, 1863. Critics have called this era of
U.S. private bank note issue the "wildcat banking" era. Collectors sometimes
call surviving private bank notes "broken bank notes", because notes from
banks that were quickly or never redeemed are much more likely to have
survived in reasonable to excellent condition.

While in most times and places, coinage was a royal or otherwise political
monopoly, there were a number of important exceptions where coins were minted
privately and successfully circulated as currency. Per monetary historian Glyn
Davies, during the English Commonwealth, Protectorate, and early Restoration
occurred "a vast issue by merchants, manufacturers, and municipalities,
between 1644 and 1672, of copper tokens, mostly of farthings and halfpence."

Ironbridge coin, minted by Coalbrookdale Works, Shropshire, England, 1782. In
the industrial revolution, factories had to attract workers with frequent pay
that could be spent at bargain shops. The Royal Mint was not producing low-
denomination coins, so factories minted their own or used the coins minted by
another firm.  A good review by Jeffrey Hummel of George Selgin's excellent
analysis of this era here.

---  
Privately minted coins from Sichuan province, China, 1912. While the minting
of private coins, especially imitations of official coins, was often banned in
order to secure a royal or other political monopoly, the industrial revolution
was not the only time or place where private entities minted.  Private coinage
was by no means even limited to the Anglosphere.  Nevertheless, the vast
majority of coins in the numismatic record were minted by or under the license
of kings, emperors, elected officials, and other kinds of political leaders,
and these are also the kinds of coins prized by political historians as the
most durable records of a leaders' reign.  
In part (ii) of this series we will explain and give a few examples of the
monetary metals themselves, usually mined and processed by private entities.
For most of monetary history, from ancient civilization until recent times,
the monetary metals were the ultimate "O" in the IOUs -- the substances that
bearer promissory notes were most often redeemed for -- and constituted the
most common contents of the coins themselves. The various forms into which
monetary metals could be shaped, including coins, were sampled and assayed for
their metal content when used outside of the locale where they were issued or
covered by legal tender laws.  
  
Part (ii) will also explain why these metals, not any of their particular
forms, are the closest analog we have to Bitcoin in monetary history. Finally,
we will cover some the many other forms besides coins that these metals could
take, the monetary and quasi-monetary functions of these forms, and get some
glimpses of even more ancient forms that were the common ancestors of modern
money and modern jewelry.  Part 2 can only scratch the surface of this vast
topic and will refer the reader to more in-depth works including those of this
author.

In order to close the theoretic gap between fiat money and private money, a
generalized notion of demurrage is critical. The government (supposedly)
protects property rights, just as does a precious metals bank protect its
deposits from theft -- deposits that back its bearer certificates. In both
cases it costs to secure the property. The way this cost gets billed is where
things seem to go awry*. Fiat money decouples issuance (source) and taxes
(sink) from the liquid value of the property rights the government is
supposedly protecting. Banks loan out their deposits at interest to pay the
protection costs. Put both of these shenanigans together and you have the
Federal Reserve. All of the Fed's noise about adjusting the "money supply" in
response to "the demand for liquidity" elides the question: What is the
fundamental source of demand for liquidity?  
  
The answer is in the risk-adjusted net present value formula which relates
static to dynamic value: The _liquid_ value of a property right is calculated
from the risk-adjusted net present value of its profit _stream_.  
  
*Cryptocurrency's equivalent of demurrage is the cost of securing the blockchain.

An excellent historical perspective. Many people believe (because of the name
Federal) that the Federal Reserve is part of the government. In a strict sense
the 'notes' issued by the Federal Reserve are along the same lines as the
private notes issued by the 'banks' i.e. private parties listed above. No more
or less "valid" other than they own a monopoly on the right to lend money to
the US Treasury department.

You might want to talk about the frequent bankruptcies from private issuers of
IOUs. The problem is fractional reserving, and inadequate reserves for losses
if an entity lends against uncertain collateral. Think of a pawn shop or a
money market fund, and you might get to the right model.

Very useful thank you. Are you going to say anything about tally sticks? I'm
trying to work out if they were a type of transaction recording mechanism that
embodied trust in the design.

With all due respect, as a student of economics, law, and your writing that
has been working on mass market adoption of blockchain, I believe you are
overlooking a simple detail...  
  
"The closest historical analog to the Bitcoin settlement layer is not to the
bank notes, nor even to the coins (despite its name), it is to the monetary
metal"  
  
"One of the more common modern legal definitions of "money", used for laws
that facilitate and support financial interchange...is that money can only be
an official government currency"  
  
  
Fiat allowed the government to print off promises of the gold reserves that
they no longer had. But while Bitcoin is finite in supply, fiat's variant
annual inflation amount (decided by a centralized union of bank and
government) is a manipulation of everything in the "governmental monetary
system"...  
  
Bitcoin's being finite yet the central financial medium between blockchain and
fiat, does this not mean that the "perfect" finite product is being converted
into an infinite fiat supply for every day use? This takes away from actual
settlement into "metal money". Unless the total metal money supply was
recorded from first block.  
  
In a perfect world, that physical/fiat/infinitely printable money would come
back into the blockchain. But governments are trying to ensure that fiat only
goes into the blockchain for their ownership (centralizing) of it to the
fullest possible degree.  
  
To address the eco-blockchain legality conundrum, I believe the ideal possible
comparison to equate a cryptocurrency's settlement layer with would be to use
your Theory of the Collectibles...many ways it would provide global
satisfaction if done with proper communal governance. Simplest being a revival
of digital altruism to combat government suppression...  
  
  
Would be honor to share my thoughts with you. Preparing a dissertation on this
and more, much inspired by your past works. My hypothesis is seemingly in
direct opposition of your part II. Hoping to hear criticisms on my theories.

"Like most blogs worth my attention, this blog is updated only infrequently.
That is because the authors of blogs worth my attention only post when they
have something to say that is true, relevant and not already known by their
audience. Most of the human race does not have the skill to know when an idea
has these three properties. The skill is particularly rare in the fields of
politics and economics, which is why this blog is such a rare and valuable
thing." \-- [Richard Hollerith](http://dl4.jottit.com/)
