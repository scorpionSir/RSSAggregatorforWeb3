Episode: #9  
April 27, 2020

Ryan & David talk with [Mariano Conti](https://twitter.com/nanexcool) about
Dai, Maker, & his epic bankless journey. Learn how Maker can help you go
bankless through this conversation with Mariano.

We talk:

  * Mariano's life in midst of Argentina's capital controls
  * Why Mariano moved from Bitcoin to DAI and Ether
  * The components of Maker including:
    * DAI (stability)
    * Vault/CDP (credit)
    * Dai Savings Rate (interest)
    * Governance (MKR token)
  * Centralization risks of Maker
  * Is Maker the last say on decentralized stablecoins?
  * What's it going to take to see 1m people into DAI?

This is our first of three episodes in the "King Money Protocols Series" where
we talk through the three most important DeFi protocols. Stay tuned for the
next two episodes!



Before the episode begins we also talk about:

  * The Lendfme hack & what it implies
