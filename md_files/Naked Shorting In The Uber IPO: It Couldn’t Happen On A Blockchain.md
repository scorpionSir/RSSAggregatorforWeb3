#  Naked Shorting In The Uber IPO: It Couldn’t Happen On A Blockchain

May 16, 2019 / [pwsadmin](https://caitlin-long.com/author/pwsadmin/) / [No
Comments](https://caitlin-long.com/naked-shorting-in-the-uber-ipo-it-couldnt-
happen-on-a-blockchain/#respond)

A curious thing happened during Uber’s troubled initial public offering last
week: naked short selling of UBER shares by the banks involved in placing
Uber’s IPO, according to several sources who confirmed this to
[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/14/uber-underwriters-worried-about-the-
ipo-deployed-unusual-naked-short.html).

Normally, [naked short
selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling) is illegal. But it
was legal in this case, and it gave the banks a chance to profit–as investors
lost money–when the IPO traded down 18% in its first two days (see
[here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/14/uber-underwriters-worried-about-the-
ipo-deployed-unusual-naked-short.html),

option-failed-uber-stock-plunged)and
[here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-stock-price-
initial-public-offering-naked-short-trade-underwriters-2019-5-1028200569)).

What’s the rub? [Naked-shorting of IPOs by banks, which the SEC green-lighted
as recently as 2015, has changed IPO market dynamics by altering the relative
power between banks, issuers and
investors.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fcaitlinlong%2F2019%2F05%2F16%2Fnaked-

To the detriment of investors, banks now have less fear of incurring major
losses from pricing an IPO too high because banks now have a tool (naked
shorting) to protect their downside risk.
