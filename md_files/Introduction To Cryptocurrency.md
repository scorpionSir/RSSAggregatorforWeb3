Since the [launch](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-
source) of the Bitcoin network in 2009, blockchain technology has created an
industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars and launched a wave of
innovation in distributed systems, cryptography, and economics. Some believe
that blockchains will be integral to the future of money, governments, and the
Internet. Others claim that this is a transient bubble, and cryptocurrencies
will be relegated to a footnote in history.‚Äå

Whatever your opinion, this course is founded on the belief that
cryptocurrencies are a subject worthy of rigorous study. In this course, we‚Äôre
going to look at the history of cryptocurrencies, examine how they work,
explore their applications, and ultimately build a blockchain and smart
contracts for ourselves.‚Äå

This course is designed to be an introduction to the many disciplines behind
cryptocurrencies. It‚Äôs intended for programmers, and most of the lessons
assume a basic knowledge of computer science. But cryptocurrencies are
inherently multidisciplinary, touching concepts from computer science,
economics, politics, and history. So even if you‚Äôre not a programmer, you can
still get some value out of this course. You‚Äôll probably get lost from time to
time, but if I'm doing my job, you‚Äôll still get the gist of it.

The course will be divided into nine modules, each with multiple lessons. The
first three chapters are available now, and we will update the links below as
new content goes live.

### Who am I

You'll naturally want to know who I am and why I'm qualified to teach you
about this whole crypto thing.

![](https://nakamoto.com/content/images/2020/01/image-1.png)

Before I got into crypto, I used to be a software engineer at Airbnb. I'd
known about crypto for a long time, but it never really clicked it until after
I played around with Ethereum in 2017. It was then that I realized: this is an
entirely new paradigm of what money can be. Money is now software. I was sure
that it would change the world. Ever since then, I've been chasing the
blockchain.

After I caught the crypto bug, I worked at Earn.com (acquired by Coinbase),
[discovered an attack against a prominent
token](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL2nE3huNiI), and started a small
crypto startup. I've taught a [course on
cryptocurrencies](https://bradfieldcs.com/courses/cryptocurrencies/) at the
Bradfield School of Computer Science, have given many technical talks at
developer meetups, and have helped inform people on the basics of crypto
through [my writings](https://haseebq.com/). Now I'm a managing partner at a
crypto venture capital firm called [Dragonfly
Capital](https://dcp.capital)‚Äîmeaning in my day job I read a lot of white
papers, evaluate technical crypto projects, and decide which ones to invest
in.

You'll notice this course is completely free, and there's a specific reason
why I want it to be free. When I first got into crypto, I remember how hard it
was to just _learn what all this stuff was_. All of the information was
fragmented, there was so much jargon and history, and it wasn't clear in what
order to even start. It took me a long time to finally get up to speed, but to
this day this space still lacks high-quality, free, up-to-date materials. I
wanted to fix that and make the educational resource that I wish I had when I
started. That turned into this course.

### How this course works

Although we‚Äôll be learning about technology, this course will not be about
learning any particular software. We won‚Äôt teach you how to format
transactions or parse the logs of any specific blockchain. Those are just
APIs, specifications, and libraries‚Äîso long as you understand the core ideas
behind how they work, you'll be able to figure out the details on your own.
But in order to compose or debug these systems, it is imperative that you
deeply understand what they are doing underneath the hood.

‚ÄåBlockchains are rich and complex systems. But this course is not designed to
be primarily academic‚Äîit is a course for builders. We're going to occasionally
work with partial fictions and slowly build up toward a more complete picture.
It's easier to see the elephant if you start with one limb and slowly zoom
out.‚Äå We will also tend to avoid academic jargon in favor of intelligibility,
although we'll include links to more technical readings for those who want to
dive deeper.

Most of the coding examples and assignments will be in Python. If you've never
used Python, it may be worth going through some [introductory
material](https://repl.it/community/classrooms/17929) first to familiarize
yourself.

Each lesson will have self-serve assignments tied to the course, both coding
assignments and multiple choice questions to test your comprehension. If you
want to get the most value out of this course, you should do the assignment
after finishing each lesson. The term project will be to create your own
fully-fledged cryptocurrency. Be sure to save your coding assignments along
the way, as they will prove useful for your term project!

Please follow [@nakamoto](https://twitter.com/nakamoto) and
[@hosseeb](https://twitter.com/hosseeb) to gain access to each lesson as it
comes out and to ask us any questions. So without further ado, let's get
started. There's much to learn. üëá
