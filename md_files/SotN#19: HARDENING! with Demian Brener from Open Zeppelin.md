**SotN#19: HARDENING! with Demian Brener from Open Zeppelin** (Harvest Hack,
Defining Trustless, New Open Zeppelin Platform: DEFENDER)

Starting with the Harvest Hack! We discuss how the Harvest Hack happened.

**Read:**

Bankless Market Monday: Are We Trustless Yet? [
https://bankless.substack.com/p/are-we-trustless-yet-market-
monday](https://bankless.substack.com/p/are-we-trustless-yet-market-monday)

Daily Gwei account of the Harvest Hack [
https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/a-rotten-harvest-the-daily-
gwei-103](https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/a-rotten-harvest-the-daily-
gwei-103)

Was this a new type of exploit? Or have we seen this type of exploit before?  
What was the weakness in Harvest‚Äôs protocol that enabled this exploit?

Was this exploit avoidable, or was that attack surface integral to how harvest
operated?

What should the Harvest team have done differently?

**Defining ‚ÄòTrustless‚Äô**

John Adler defines trustless as these two things  
1\. You always have your money  
2\. No one can steal your money Do you agree with this definition of
trustless? How would you define trustless?

**New Open Zeppelin Platform: DEFENDER**  
We're going to get into what this is and how it is helping harden DeFi Ship
faster with lower risk.

Automate your Ethereum operations to deliver high-quality products faster with
less risk to users. <https://openzeppelin.com/defender/>
