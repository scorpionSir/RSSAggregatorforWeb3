# Ex-FDIC Regulator On Trust And the Battle of the Social Media Videos

Sep 29, 2020  
  

When Jason Brett first arrived at the FDIC, he was greeted with the joke that
he should have brought a pillow to work at the sleepy agency. Little did he
know that, within a week in that summer of 2008, he would have a front-row
seat to what was the largest bank collapse in U.S. history. The Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation took over IndyMac Bank and Jason learned then
that the banking deposit system depended simply on trust.

> "We live in this fractionalized reserve banking system and one of the stakes
> that was very high at the FDIC was securing the public's confidence, making
> sure the public was confident knowing that their money was backed by the
> FDIC," Jason said on the latest episode of [Follow the White
> Rabbit](https://www.orchid.com/podcast) podcast.

Jason recounted how initially only senior citizens -- seared with memories of
the impact from the Great Depression -- immediately took all of their deposits
out of the California bank. But younger customers seemed comfortable at first
with keeping their money with the bank ... until people started posting
YouTube videos of long lines of depositors outside branches. That sparked a
shift where suddenly people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s joined a run on the
bank

> "We quickly realized that we were facing the first social media banking
> crisis," Jason said.

That launched a public awareness and public relations campaign by the FDIC
with the agency's head Sheila Bair organizing an alternative narrative with
YouTube videos designed to reassure depositors their money was safe at the
bank.

The experience as an intern and junior analyst propelled Jason's thinking and
exploration about the concept of money and ultimately fuelled his
understanding of the significance in the world of cryptocurrency.

> "We really learned that people did not trust banks outright after 2008, and
> that change has raised the stakes, highlighting the leverage that money and
> power has over people," he said.

Since those FDIC days, Jason has been the compliance examiner for the Making
Home Affordable Program (HAMP) with the Treasury, and, active in bitcoin and
blockchain since 2016, he is now the CEO of Value Technology, a D.C. think
tank focused on blockchain advocacy, education, research and application.

Cryptocurrency has forced people around the globe to consider the concepts of
money, Jason said. In September, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
even acknowledged that the U.S. dollar has no intrinsic value. That, according
to Jason, is "screaming heresy" for a regulator.

> "We have all recognized that cryptocurrency has a place in society and we
> need to take advantage of the education opportunities that are going to open
> up. Otherwise people will make investment decisions that are harmful to
> them," he said.

> "We owe it to ourselves as a community to do something like this or I think
> the government will make us do something like this five or ten years down
> the road," he warned.
