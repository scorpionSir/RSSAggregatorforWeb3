## Berlin Blockchain Week: The Birth of an AKASHA Hub

By [Joshua Long](/blog/author/joshua-long/) & [Soenke
Bartling](/blog/author/soenke-bartling/)

¬∑

September 09, 2019

On Thursday 22 August 2019, during Berlin Blockchain Week, AKASHA hosted the
inaugural event for the AKASHA Hub Berlin. This event took place from
6:30-8:30pm in [the Blockchain Embassy](https://embassy.berlin/) which is
located at [Manteuffelstra√üe
77](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=52.497658%2C13.425212).
**A big thanks to the hosts for having us! üôè**

The Blockchain Embassy is the initial physical location that will be
frequently returned to in order to facilitate Hub events; however, in contrast
to other hubs in Barcelona or Dublin, where events always take place in the
same established spaces, the Embassy is just the seed point for a community
brought together by common values, goals, interests etc. without the need for
a fixed, common space. üë®‚ÄçüöÄüí•üë©‚ÄçüöÄ

As AKASHA Founder, Mihai Alisie, wrote in [the op-ed which announced his
departure from the post of editor-in-chief of Bitcoin
Magazine](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:x3cKvfvBZwQJ:https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/a-new-
chapter-begins-1396914264+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk) (a cached version is the
only one available at the time of writing):

_Holons are ... highly innovative and agile hubs synced across the globe, with
the mission of enabling people to develop world changing tools ‚Äì transparency,
openness, inclusiveness, fairness and purposefulness being the defining traits
of this new model._

A hub is defined as _the effective center of an activity, region, or network._
It seems obvious to us that **the center of an AKASHA Hub is the community
that forms to meet, debate, present, drink, talk, and laugh together.** To
this end, the AKASHA Hub Berlin seeks to facilitate coming together around
people, ideas, and events, rather than bricks, chairs, and projectors. This
being said, all of these things, and more, were present for the first-ever
event. üöÄ

The first ever AKASHA Hub Berlin event kicked off with a talk by [AKASHA Hub
Barcelona](https://akasha.org/hub-bcn/) creator, Lorenzo Patuzzo, who
presented on the theme of hubs, drawing upon his experience of creating and
operating one. The 280m¬≤ Hub in Barcelona that Lorenzo operates includes desk
workspaces, a hardware hacklab, a meeting room, a chilling zone, and a
multipurpose social area for gatherings and meetups.

David Bovill followed Lorenzo, expanding upon this theme, and putting across
his ideas on how collaboration and governance could work through the Hub
Network.

Bartling talks Blockchain for Science and AKASHA üß™_

Soenke Bartling, creator of AKASHA Hub Berlin, rounded off the discussion by
talking about [Blockchain for Science](https://www.blockchainforscience.com/),
a group looking to fix the problems of reproducibility and incentivize true
innovation within the scientific community by utilizing blockchain
technologies. Soenke finished the presentation off by explaining why he had
decided to get involved in the AKASHA Hub Network, and talking about creating
novel incentive structures beyond ‚Äúlikes‚Äù around ideas and innovation sharing
- for which blockchain technology is uniquely suited.

After the talks, a slice of interested individuals continued to hang around
for another 2 hours, debating subjects such as the Hub Network and intra-
network coordination, under the guidance of David Bovill. Conversations on
these subjects continued at dinner later that evening, and throughout the days
that followed...

Once again, the Hub Network has expanded that little bit more, adding an extra
node that will seek to expand collective minds at local, regional, and global
scales. If you're interested in getting involved with the AKASHA Hub Berlin
specifically, you can [join their community on
meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Akasha-Hub-Berlin/).

If this article has started to get your creative juices flowing, and made you
think _why is there no AKASHA Hub in my town/city/county/state/country?_ ü§î Why
not [get in touch](/cdn-cgi/l/email-

information on how you could help the Hub Network become better, bigger, and
brighter. ‚ú®
