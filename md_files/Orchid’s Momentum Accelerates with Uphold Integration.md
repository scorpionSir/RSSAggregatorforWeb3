# Orchid’s Momentum Accelerates with Uphold Integration

Aug 12, 2020  
  

OXT, the Orchid token, is now fully integrated with
[Uphold](https://uphold.com/en-us/), a multi-asset trading platform that
allows people to buy, sell, and exchange diverse assets including fiat
currency, precious metals, and crypto. With this milestone, people can now
deposit and withdraw OXT through Uphold to external wallets, as well as buy,
hold and send on the platform. Uphold has integrations with 30+ digital
currencies, 27 national fiat currencies including the US dollar and euro, and
four major precious metals, for a total of over 1,000 trading pairs.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO said:

> Uphold's cross-asset model advances the cause of a decentralized economy by
> making it seamless to trade across fiat and digital currencies as well as
> precious metals. The Orchid team is excited to be integrated with Uphold and
> we look forward to working with them to further our shared goals."

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match
supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. People use OXT to
fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go
basis. Orchid also offers [in-app purchases](/orchid-launches-in-apple-app-
store/) that, while still powered by OXT, allow people to buy "pre-filled"
accounts the same way they would make a purchase in any other app.
