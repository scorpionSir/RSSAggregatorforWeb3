> #### `Election Betting Roundup`

Tis the season to roll up oneâ€™s sleeves, hunker down with oneâ€™s favorite
political betting blogs, and get ready to profit.

The impeachment saga seems to be ending, or just beginning, depending on how
you look at it. Those that bet on the 1st term and 2019 impeachment slept well
this week after the House brought and approved two articles of impeachment
against President Trump.

With the impeachment being a foregone conclusion, letâ€™s shift to the odds of a
Senate conviction. In contrast to the new highs in impeachment markets,
conviction markets are still indicating quite the long shot for the removal of
the president.

In fact, impeachment and the surrounding drama have seemed to have spurred the
support of Trump for re-election. As you can see below, the PredictIt price
for shares in his re-election has been steadily rising amidst this process.

If youâ€™ve been following our good friend Ben over at the [Augur
Edge](https://mailchi.mp/6eba680b9080/weekly-insights), heâ€™s been slinging hot
predictions right out of the oven. In Tuesdayâ€™s Edge, he detailed his
inclination to buy shares of Amy Klobuchar in the DemNom and GenElection
markets:

>  _I  bought Klobuchar YES shares in the Demnom market at ~3 cents and in the
> General election market at ~2 centsâ€¦I don't think she's getting the
> nomination, but I think she will bounce in coming weeks._

Well, in a matter of days, not weeks, Klobucharâ€™s odds surged. Following
Thursdayâ€™s DemDebate in Los Angeles, where she was widely hailed as having a
strong performance, her odds of the nomination have reached .08/share (+167%)
and the presidency, .04/share (+100%). Great pick Ben, in the spirit of
Christmas, we hope you donâ€™t stop gifting us these great tips. If youâ€™re into
things like prediction markets and profit, go give [Augur
Edge](https://mailchi.mp/6eba680b9080/weekly-insights) a follow!

Moreover, Ben goes into detail about the relative benefits of PredictIt vs
Augur. He lays out a whole host of the advantages of Augur, including one that
addresses a problem Iâ€™ve been seeing often:

On Twitter, youâ€™ll find a graveyard of folk asking for markets that never
materialize; whereas on Augur, one can simply make it themselves:
