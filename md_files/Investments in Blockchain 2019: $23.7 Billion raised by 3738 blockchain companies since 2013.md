## A new study of blockchain investments by Outlier Ventures in early-stage
rounds reveals that $23.7 billion has been raised since 2013 with focus moving
from purely cryptocurrency to new applications.

Leading blockchain and Web 3.0 venture capital firm Outlier Ventures today
published it’s latest [Investments in Blockchain
report](https://www.slideshare.net/OVioHQ/investments-in-
blockchains-2019-outlier-ventures-163458637), which provides an overview into
blockchain investment and market trends worldwide since 2013.

The report reveals a range of insights into the market:

  * $23.7 Billion raised by 3738 blockchain companies since 2013

  * Early-stage fundraising high in the count, but follow on rounds few and scarce

Blockchain startups have raised finance in multiple forms including ICOs,
debt, direct investments and crowd-funding. However, discounting a handful of
exchanges and wallets, there hasn’t been an application that has broken
through to mainstream adoption, yet. This definitely isn’t for lack of
capital. The challenge is more about expertise and guidance at early stages,
especially when it comes to areas unique to Web3 such as token design.

Joel John, Research Analyst at Outlier Ventures explains:

> “There is often an expertise gap with capital investments. The heavy
> competition in early-stage financing for blockchain-based startups means a
> large number of investors provide nothing more than capital. Investments in
> equity are considered a hedge against liquid tokens.
>
> “In addition to a lack of much-needed guidance during the early stages, this
> also brings along expectations of quick exits from investors that are used
> to typically being in liquid assets like ICO tokens.”

### 75% of all deal flow focused only on early-stage rounds

In 2019, the frequency of blockchain investments will be up nine times in
comparison to 2013. Pre-seed, Seed and Angel rounds account for ~75% of all
the deals in the ecosystem.

![Investments in Blockchain 2019: $23.7 Billion raised by 3738 blockchain

The number of early-stage backers has increased substantially due to the
massive returns from early investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, this
financing has not converted to follow on-rounds and indicates that while
early-stage funding is relatively easy, many traditional VCs are waiting for
evidence of product-market fit and clearer signs of revenue before making
further investments.

> Joel John, explains further: “Average seed amounts are healthy, but evolving
> to reach a Series B raise is a hard business. Challenges with learning
> curves in user-experience and designing profitable business models make it
> difficult for startups in the ecosystem to evolve past a point.
>
> “Blockchain startups have the two-fold challenge of establishing a new
> paradigm and warding off existing competition - a hard task to do without
> the necessary guidance in place.”

In terms of blockchain investment focus area, Bitcoin’s early mover advantage
and network effects meant most teams focusing on the space early on were
building specifically for it.

However, there is a shift from focusing purely on cryptocurrency to
convergence applications. AI leads the pack, with Fintech and data analytics
starting to close the gap. A growing area of focus is data ownership, along
with increasing new interest in self-sovereign identity following the recent
data exploitation scandals.

### Fundraising is cyclical

Founders are dependent on Bitcoin’s price to raise capital for what may not
necessarily be a token dependent project. The heavy exposure of institutional
players in the ecosystem to token prices swing risk appetites on the basis of
how tokens perform.

This means there’s greater competition to raise capital from a handful of
backers during bear markets, and also competition against a number of other
equally well-funded projects during bull markets. Expertise and value-added
services are the only key differentiators that teams can rely upon.

### Location matters for future funding

Founder access to a network in regions where funding activity is active
determines the possibility of the company going on to raise follow-on rounds.
The United States leads globally when considered at a national level. However,
regional FinTech hubs such as London are catching up with former favourites
such as San Francisco. London has evolved to be a hub for early-stage
companies looking to raise seed stage rounds, roughly $1 billion has been
raised by companies in London since 2013.
