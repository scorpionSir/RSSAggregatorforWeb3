### _Newly appointed Partner Rumi Morales to lead Outlier’s participation in
world’s leading blockchain trade organization_



Leading blockchain and Web 3.0 venture capital firm Outlier Ventures today
announces it has joined the Chamber of Digital Commerce to actively support
the organisation’s mission of promoting the acceptance and use of digital
assets.

The Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world’s largest blockchain trade
organization, is a leading voice in advocating and promoting digital assets
and blockchain-based technologies. Outlier Ventures’ newest Partner, Rumi
Morales, sits on the Chamber’s Advisory Board alongside leaders such as Blythe
Masters of Digital Asset and Dr. James Newsome, former Chairman of the CFTC.

Speaking of the decision Morales said:

> _“One of the reasons I joined Outlier Ventures was the level of thoughtful
> research and public engagement the firm has developed. The Chamber has been
> the leading authority for blockchain innovation at the intersection of
> innovation, investment and policy, and it has been an honor serving on their
> Advisory Board. Joining the Chamber is a win-win for both organizations, as
> Outlier steps up its efforts both in Europe and the United States to educate
> communities about the tremendous opportunity digital assets represent.”_

Morales will lead Outlier Venture’s engagement with the Chamber, contributing
to education and advocacy initiatives that foster engagement with
policymakers, regulatory agencies and industry at large.

Perianne Boring, founder and president, Chamber of Digital Commerce:

> _“As a valuable member of our Advisory Board, Rumi Morales provides
> strategic input and insights to the work of the Chamber. We are pleased to
> welcome Outlier Ventures to our membership. We are grateful for their
> thought leadership and support of our work to educate lawmakers on the
> importance of blockchain technology.”_

Jamie Burke, CEO at Outlier Ventures added:

> _“Scarce digital assets underpinned by distributed ledgers promise to change
> how we do business and even how we live. The more we talk about that change
> the more beneficial it will be. We’re honoured to be supporting the
> Chamber’s important work in this area.”_

Outlier Ventures is actively working with policy makers and the wider industry
to further knowledge sharing on the evolution of decentralised technologies.
The company is engaged with the All-Party Parliamentary Group on blockchain
and sits on Tech UK’s distributed ledger working group.

The recently published [Convergence Ecosystem
report](https://outlierventures.io/research/introducing-the-convergence-
ecosystem/) from Outlier Ventures is also now available and outlines the
evolving decentralised technology stack and the emerging foundations of a new
data infrastructure, which supports entirely new economic models.
