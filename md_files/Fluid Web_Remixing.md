The more mature the social media platform the harder it is [to mine social
capital](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service). At the
maturity of a given platform it is as difficult to become famous as is in old
media. The only opportunities present emerging subgroups but thatâ€™s also very
difficult. Therefore; there will be a new generation of social media platforms
to accommodate the demand for social capital mining.

Homsi @homsiTMan, tiktok is absolutely wild. My friend posted a 7 second video
a week ago. Last night it blew up: went from ~1000 views to 16 million views
(and still going at about 1M/hour...) Insane. Is there any other platform
where you can get _that_ much exposure so
quickly?](https://twitter.com/homsiT/status/1218610958840451073)

The work rewarded by the next gen social will not be on a content creation
side as there already is oversupply of content. The most valuable work will be
related to content curation. Making sense of the information and media might
be a hallmark of the new era on the internet.

Why should this be more valuable? I imagine this would yield a more fluid
internet - content will become even more liquid and is meaningfully linked,
flexed and remixed. When there is an abundance of content itâ€™s the sense-
making that generates most value.

In The Inevitable, Kevin Kelly states that â€˜growth comes from remixingâ€™. He
interprets [Paul Romer writes](https://paulromer.net/economic-growth/) that
â€˜at the most basic level, an economy grows when whenever people take resources
and rearrange them in a way that makes them more valuableâ€™.

Kelly concludes that â€˜in 30 years the most important cultural works and the
most powerful mediums will be those that have been remixed the mostâ€™.

 _[Remixing](https://www.youtube.com/user/akirathedon) is a discoverability
layer. Why would you become a podcaster if you can become a Bitcaster? Why
tweet if you can clip a â€˜bitâ€™? _
