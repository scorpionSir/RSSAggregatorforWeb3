## A call for interdisciplinarity — generative identity and the Internet
Identity Workshop

By [Philip Sheldrake](/blog/author/philip-sheldrake/)

·

September 30, 2019

The post [_Generative identity — beyond self-
sovereignty_](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/09/02/generative-identity-beyond-
self-sovereignty) (2nd September) has spawned a lot of conversation in private
channels and on [the ProjectVRM Harvard mailing
list](https://cyber.harvard.edu/lists/info/projectvrm) ... some 15,000 words
in exchanges with more than a dozen people active in ‘digital identity’. This
post is dedicated to the most salient parts by way of making a contribution
from a distance to the 29th [Internet Identity
Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/) (IIW) taking place this week
at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Living eight time
zones away, I have not yet had the opportunity to attend an IIW, and this
occasion is no exception unfortunately.

This is a call to action. Whether it succeeds or not in that respect will
depend in good part on how well I’ve been able to communicate the severity of
the problem with the current trajectory — in terms of our psychological,
societal, and ecological health — and how well I’ve been able to make the
ethical case for the urgency of interdisciplinarity. Beyond that, it is in the
hands of those leading the ‘identity community’.

For the avoidance of any doubt whatsoever, I have no reason to criticize the
personal values and aspirations of any individuals with whom I’ve been
privileged to engage in this community. No-one here wants to achieve the
opposite effect to the one they set out to secure. These are quite simply
impossible matters to approach through a mono-disciplinary lens — hence my
objective to help open this out at the earliest possible opportunity.

Reviewing the [proposed
topics](https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_29_Proposed_Topics) for this week’s IIW
event, it’s clear that it’s as dedicated to identification (a claims
verification process) as it is identity. But perhaps that’s not quite right
either. When considering the [RWOT functional definition of
identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-
and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md) — identity is how we
recognize, remember, and ultimately respond to specific people and things —
and contrasting it with the IIW’s logo and agenda, it is perhaps more accurate
to say that the workshop is dedicated to anonymity and privacy.

While the ‘ _Internet Anonymity and Claims Verification Processes Workshop_ ’
doesn’t quite have the same ring, this isn’t a trivial observation. Two
significant ramifications come to mind.

The first is simply that some people think they’re working directly on
identity when they are in fact working directly on anonymity and claims
verification processes, this response for example:

> identity in the world is mostly what I do when another needs to know
> something about me.

In doing anything (and sometimes by not doing anything!), you take in,
process, and send out information in the context of relationships. And this is
not constrained to "when another needs to know". We cannot help take in,
process, and send out information all the time in the context of
relationships, all of which contributes to our multiple concurrent identities
(in the verb-like sense, in the narrative sense, in others' eyes). Hence the
generative identity principle of co-constitution.

The second ramification is that those working directly on anonymity and claims
verification processes are in fact working indirectly on identity because the
conceptualizations overlap inseparably, and they are then operating in the
identity zone so to speak without, it seems, appropriate context and framing.

It’s not too much of a stretch to moot that most people in the ‘identity
community’ have a working appreciation for noun-like identity and almost none
for the essential, quotidian verb-like. I consider this a shortcoming of the
shared endeavour rather than anything personal. Here’s a response I offered to
someone deliberately avoiding “identity” in describing their work:

> In working with medical information, in working with medically-oriented
> relationships, you are 100% working with verb-like identity ... Not
> referencing it specifically doesn't change the fact. Medical information and
> relations with physicians aren't merely associated with 'an identity', they
> manifest in ever-changing identities. In other words, they shape 'who we
> are' in contexts and 'how we become' in contexts.

These two ramifications are perhaps the most significant insight of my past
four weeks. I attribute it to my observation in the generative identity post
that the ‘identity community’ appears to be almost entirely mono-disciplinary
— technological, with a smattering of legal expertise. At minimum we’re
missing psychologists, sociologists, ecologists, and complexity scientists.
No-one has countered otherwise, meaning we likely have a state of affairs I
describe in the generative identity post as unethical by itself — and it’s not
too hard to appreciate then why ‘digital identity’ might not be heading for a
good place. (It’s also noteworthy that the community is unrepresentative,
being predominantly white and male.)

Could the individual ‘user’ do with some anonymity and the individual agency
to present verified claims? Yes indeed, sounds good. But as a complex human
being woven into the complexities of society and the complexities of the
broader environment, Alice’s best interests can only be served when
interdisciplinary teams determine to anticipate the emergent consequences of
their work, and indeed design for it. The best way to serve Alice and Bob is
to work towards the benefit of the species and therefore our environment. The
best way to serve the species is to support Alice et al in their diversity and
agency within the complex adaptive system we call society. In other words we
have to design for all scales and varied contexts.

And yet astonishingly just one interlocutor to date has made fleeting
reference to my emphasizing emergence, and there has been very little
acknowledgement of this being a sociotechnological rather than merely
technological system. On the contrary:

> [The SSI discussion seeks] to separate the political ambitions of SSI from
> its technical realization. … I recommend a similar tactic for your
> "generative identity". IMO, it conflates the political with the technical
> and as such, undermines both. Those who care about either will get caught up

This artificial separation of the social / political and technological is at
the heart of the problem here. They are of course utterly inseparable. To
design the latter in the vacuum of the other is unethical, and frankly
dangerous (by which I mean people will suffer in consequence). As Einstein
noted, everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. What
is described here as “caught up in the nits,” I recognize as simpler than
possible. Generative identity is the antithesis of this recommendation to
repeat this error. (See the section in the generative identity post on
"separation of concerns".)

If any ‘identity community’ has, say, technologists representing more than a
third of the collaborative group, then by definition other essential
disciplines are under-represented and any recommended architectures will more
than likely be fundamentally flawed. And given that we’re designing something
so incredibly close to the human condition and the fundamental fabric of our
societies, where very many people have been excluded, persecuted, and murdered
with the assistance of prior identity architectures, this would be
unacceptable. It’s why I tend to write ‘identity community’ in single quote
marks — it cannot constitute community with its current homogeneity.

‘Digital identity’ today lacks the requisite variety of disciplines,
conceptualizations, and protocols to rise up to the complexities of the human
condition, of societies, of ecology. Given the frictionless medium, the
virality of human relations, and the [support of
governments](https://www.coindesk.com/catalonia-government-to-build-dlt-based-
identity-platform-for-citizens), the emergent and potentially rapid
consequences of this trajectory are frightening. A system adhering to or
influenced by the founding SSI principles will I believe, ironically enough,
be utterly disempowering for the individual, through emergence, through
structuration.

So what of those [founding
principles](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-
soverereign-identity.html) I critique in the generative identity post, and the
associated characteristics and consequences?

I’ve been told that the principles are three years old, and:

> ... have served as a rallying cry, not a blueprint. SSI has evolved greatly
> over the last three years and will continue to evolve. No one takes them out
> in meetings and measures what we’re doing against the principles.

I have not been pointed to a revised set of principles. This urges a polemical
question — does this mean SSI currently has no principles?! Ethically, a set
of principles must be determined in interdisciplinary forum and they most
definitely should be taken out in meetings to guide and assess progress.
Generative identity offers a distinct set of candidate principles.

[UPDATE 4 Oct 2019 — [a Twitter exchange about Sovrin's
principles](https://twitter.com/windley/status/1179425599133278214).]

As for contrasting the characteristics and consequences of SSI and generative
identity, I drafted the following comparison table for convenience, [you can
download it as a .pdf here](https://www.philipsheldrake.com/wp/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/generative-identity-and-self-sovereign-identity.pdf):

[ ![generative identity and self sovereign
identity](/static/4843b87a26691d077c0801c42266102e/fcda8/generative-identity-
and-self-sovereign%20identity.png)
](/static/4843b87a26691d077c0801c42266102e/c9c44/generative-identity-and-self-
sovereign%20identity.png)

I was challenged by a leader of [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/):

> It’s easy to argue against something if you get to define it and make it
> anything you like so that you can use it in contrast with the thing you’d
> like to promote. … you’ve created a caricature of SSI that no one working on
> it would recognize. In fact, if someone were to describe Sovrin using the
> phrases in your generative identity column, I’d say they were right on.

This attracted support from a fellow Sovrin leader:

> What you call "generative identity", Philip, is what I call "SSI done
> right".

The generative identity post argues that identity cannot be self-sovereign by
the RWOT functional definition. It describes the flaws in four founding /
“rallying cry” principles. But no-one has yet engaged with the critique at
this level of detail. My response to these objections:

> If this is “SSI done right”, that would be wonderful. Just because I don’t
> see it doesn’t mean it isn’t. But I don’t see the co-constitution principle
> in the architecture, or attendance to near inevitable emergent outcomes, or

> deliberation, etc., but I will keep looking and learning!
>

I do hope this conversation continues, openly ideally, but privately as
needed. It would, I humbly propose from a distance, make for a valuable
session at IIW this week.

We’re hoping to convene a suitably interdisciplinary community, or community
of communities, and we will need your help. If you or your organization or
community can help make this happen — if you understand the need for some deep
and meaningful interdisciplinary action — please get in touch now. Thanks in
advance.

Appropriately, I will finish this post with a contribution from a practitioner
of one of those disciplines we need at the table — a knowledge ecologist.
[Christina Bowen](https://sensecompass.com/team) traces the transformation of
information to knowledge in human systems the way an ecologist might follow
the transfer of sunlight to different forms of energy moving through a
wetland. Indeed, her career started in wetland ecology.
