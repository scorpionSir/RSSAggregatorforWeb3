# Bringing basketball to the blockchain

## Dapper Labs, the NBA and the NBPA are working together to shape the future
of basketball fandom using blockchain technology.

# It’s primetime for mainstream adoption

If you were one of the millions of people that watched the high-flying action
in the NBA this past season, then you’re part of a sports community that is
getting more and more used to a level of drama, skill, and breathtaking
moments that seem unmatched in the sports world. By any measure, the NBA is
one of the world’s most global sports leagues and its popularity continues to
grow with:

  * One of the largest social media communities in the world, with 1.6 billion likes and followers globally across all league, team, and player platforms.
  * Games and programming in 50 languages across 215 countries and territories.

We’re eager to show the NBA’s worldwide audience the value of blockchain
technology through [NBA Top
Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/?utm_source=dappermedium&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=nbaannouncement).
That’s why we’ll be working directly with basketball fans to build an
experience that’s relevant to them and rooted in basketball culture.

# Introducing NBA Top Shot

NBA Top Shot will feature a social experience built around limited-edition
digital collectibles, as well as a variety of games and experiences anchored
around the collectibles designed to create a fun, authentic, and accessible
fan engagement on blockchain technology.

Unlike other sports games or fantasy brackets, players can acquire live, in-
game moments from the NBA season, like a Kawhi Leonard buzzer-beater. Players
can also acquire history-making moments, such as Klay Thompson scoring 37
points in a quarter, Giannis Antetokounmpo being named the 2018–19 MVP and
Dirk Nowitzki’s last basket as a Dallas Maverick. Embedded in the digital
collectibles are real-world data that defines these moments and plays an
influential role in a variety of different games.

These digital collectibles are more than just memorabilia that fans can own
and use forever — they’re game pieces in upcoming experiences. Players will be
able to trade, compete with, and use these items in online tournaments and
leagues.

Like all [Dapper
Labs](https://dapperlabs.com/?utm_source=dappermedium&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=nbaannouncement)
products, NBA Top Shot will deliver a high-quality user experience and the
unique benefits that blockchain offers: true ownership, immutability, and the
ability to transfer value in a peer-to-peer marketplace.

# The serious business of fun and games on the blockchain

In 2017, we created
[CryptoKitties](https://cryptokitties.co/?utm_source=dappermedium&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=nbaannouncement)
to show the world that blockchain technology could be fun and consumer-
friendly. We’re applying the lessons we’ve learned from CryptoKitties, and
more recently [Cheeze
Wizards](https://cheezewizards.com/?utm_source=dappermedium&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=nbaannouncement),
to continue to improve blockchain’s user experience dramatically.

As we continue to expand the reach of decentralized technology, we are working
to bring an experience that’s exciting and relevant to basketball fans across
the world. The NBA Top Shot team is led by Santiago Jaramillo and Caty Tedman.
Santiago brings over 10 years of experience building and launching AAA games,
most recently as Creative Director for EA Sports’ FIFA. Caty has a vast
knowledge of sports from years leading data-driven decisions and strategy at
the NFL, NHL, and NBA on ESPN.

> “With NBA Top Shot, basketball fans can engage with their favorite players,
> teams, and each other in entirely new ways. We’re using blockchain
> technology to create assets and experiences that are guaranteed limited
> edition and authentic, not to mention portable and permanent, in a way
> nothing digital has ever been before.”  
>  — Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs.

Sign up to check out NBA Top Shot first, and help shape basketball’s digital
future.
