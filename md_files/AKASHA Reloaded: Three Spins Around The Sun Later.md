## AKASHA Reloaded: Three Spins Around The Sun Later

By [Mihai Alisie](/blog/author/mihai-alisie/)

¬∑

May 03, 2019

On May 3rd 2016, [279 days A.E.](https://etherscan.io/block/1) (After
Ethereum), we unveiled the AKASHA dapp and opened the signups for the alpha
version to celebrate [World Press Freedom
Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day). We called for
brave people to help us test the idea of a decentralized social network, built
with Ethereum and IPFS, to be censorship-resistant by design.

We didn't know what to expect. Amazingly, the response was both overwhelming
and humbling at the same time. Words cannot truly express the spectrum of
emotions we felt back then, but it turned out we were not the only ones
excited about this idea:

> 2016](https://twitter.com/AkashaProject/status/737676295832805376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Before the end of the month, over 2,000 people signed up to help us test the
idea. By December, when we started sending the alpha 0.1 dapp invitations, we
were **amazed** to see the counter now showing over 7,000 signups.

What‚Äôs even more impressive is that these people found us - **and each other**
\- organically through blog posts published on [our
website](https://akasha.org/blog/), [reddit
posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4hm678/unveiling_akasha_a_nextgeneration_social_media/)
and [tweets](https://twitter.com/AkashaProject/status/727396778996318208?s=20)
\- without paid advertising.

A couple of weeks after finishing sending all the invites and patching the
first round of bugs with the help of all these brave pioneers, we shipped the
public alpha 0.2 release and announced it with [this
post](https://akasha.org/blog/2017/01/16/into-the-ether):

> (...)
>
> **Now, even if we don 't know everything from the start, we know something -
> basic human rights such as freedom of expression and privacy must be part of
> the solution(s). Otherwise, they're not good solutions.**
>
> **We believe that continuous experimentation is the key to discovering new
> services and features we cannot even imagine at this point. Some could
> reinvent whole industries and business models. Others will fail miserably,
> and we will learn something new in the process.**
>
> **It will be a marathon, not a sprint, but we expect every step of it to be
> enlightening.**
>
> (...)

Following this post, ~10,000 identities were created **_(over 9,000!!!)_**
inside the alpha dapp.

Fast forward to the 4th of November 2017 (or 5th depending on timezone), we
[presented the beta version](https://akasha.org/blog/2017/11/14/new-horizons)
and opened the signups at the Ethereum DEVCON 3 conference.

![unveiling](/static/47738b63d22737dc9f42aebf2d31f0db/1c72d/unveiling.jpg)

The beta was more or less a new application, (re)written from scratch. By
December 23rd 2017, we sent the beta invites as a nice Christmas
present....but this time to **over 40,000 people**! üéÖüéÑüéÅ

The next few weeks were spent fixing bugs and polishing the dapp before
opening [the beta in February 2018](https://akasha.org/blog/2018/02/10/akasha-
beta-emergence).

[A couple of months later](https://akasha.org/blog/2018/04/18/akasha-web-mend-
the-gap) we also released the beta web version and invited everyone to help us
stress test the apps, smart contract architecture, and cryptoeconomic ideas.
The web version of the beta was also in some ways a new dapp on its own, with
the IPFS part completely rewritten in IPFS.js to enable browser peer-to-peer
communication.

Since then, the marathon continued and we found ourselves understanding that
sometimes it‚Äôs not just about ‚ÄúBUIDLing‚Äù. When contemplating the importance of
the challenge at hand, it felt irresponsible to build a product with a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs
move fast and break things‚Äù mentality.

This is why we tried as much as possible to **first think and then build with
purpose**. **It is also why we** [enshrined this mindset as one of our core
values.](https://akasha.org/about/#values)

The marathon began with us testing the idea of a social network dapp. In its
first iteration, that meant signing up, following, posting, voting and
commenting through an User Interface operating on Ethereum and IPFS. The
original alpha dapp design was done using the Keynote app and many, many,
many, many duplicate slides.

Since then, it is a continuous process of ‚Äúscratching the surface‚Äù in an
attempt to understand ‚Äúthe possibilities‚Äù opened by these new technologies. In
our imagination we are moving towards something taking the shape of a ‚Äúnetwork
of social networks,‚Äù modular and interoperable by design. üåç

We have many examples of successful Web 2.0 social media network copycats.
Each social network is fighting for the human social graph and walls people
in, one way or another. We can expect a similar trajectory for blockchain
social media networks. Especially when someone could fork the code and change
a few lines to add their own ‚ú®token‚ú®.

But what if we make it easy to customize and deploy a social network for a
specific need or purpose? What if the replication of successful social
networks becomes an evolutionary advantage instead of a threat by design? And
what if each social network becomes a portal to a bigger,
[**_meta_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta), **** social network emerging
from the network of social networks effect? ü§î

**This marathon is _indeed_ enlightening. And, at the same time, still just
beginning.**

Those just joining us in this evolution, can check [the first part of the
Metamorphosis
series](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/15/akasha-2019-metamorphosis-part1)
alongside [the second part](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/05/03/diving-into-
the-oceans-of-time-metamorphosis-part2) for more information on how we reached
this stage. As for the ones that have been alongside us throughout this
adventure, we'd like to say that these years also made us realize how lucky we
are.

**Lucky to be alive during these times, lucky to be a part of this space, and
even luckier to have you, the Community, at our side on the front lines -
actively co-creating this new world.**

Your support has been truly invaluable along the way... on many occasions.

Your kind words and warm encouragements made us believe in ourselves even when
solutions seemed out of reach. Even better, you helped us to get out of our
comfort zone and walk that "extra, extra mile" in search for better answers.

Among all the hype, craziness and uncertainty surrounding the blockchain
landscape, we found something to center us. Your support. From the bottom of
our hearts, we want to say: **_thank you!!!_** ü§óü§óü§ó

Thanks to you, today, exactly 1,095 days after the unveiling the AKASHA idea
and app for the first time, we are celebrating the World Press Freedom day
together again.

The new [AKASHA.world](https://akasha.world) will represent the convergence of
all the ideas, conversations and experiments unfolded throughout the last
three years. After tirelessly researching and developing a decentralized
social network designed to enable individual self-expression, we feel that
we've reached the required level of understanding for **the next challenge:
collective self-expression**.
