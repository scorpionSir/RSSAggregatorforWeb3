**32 - The Bull Case for NFTs | Jake Burkhman & Andrew Steinwold**

There's something bubbling under the surface with NFTs. A lot of really smart
people are starting to make a lot of noise about the coming wave of NFT

What can we do with them?

Are they really all that unique?

What is so powerful about a Non-Fungible Token?

Jake Burkhman, founder of CoinFund, is particularly bullish on this sector of
Ethereum.

Andrew Steinwold, host of a podcast exclusively dedicated to NFTs, thinks that
the world of NFTs will dwarf the world of DeFi by orders of magnitude.

What makes these two individuals so optimistic about NFTs?  
Listen to find out!
