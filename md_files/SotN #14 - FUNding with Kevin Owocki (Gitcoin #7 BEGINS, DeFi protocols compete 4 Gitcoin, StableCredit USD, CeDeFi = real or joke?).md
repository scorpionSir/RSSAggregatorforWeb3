STATE OF THE NATION #14 - Tuesday, September 15th, 2020

Watch on the [Bankless YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/bankless)

The State of the Bankless Nation is....FUNding

It that time of year....GITCOIN TIME!!!

Every quarter, 4 times a year, Gitcoin Grants rolls around. This is one of the
few times where the money in your wallet means 10x more than it used to...
IF... AND ONLY IF.... you donate to your favorite DeFi and Ethereum
infrastructure.

We bring on Kevin Owocki, el presidente of Gitcoin, to discuss the role of
Gitcoin in funding the DeFi ecosystem and the technology behind funding public
goods.
