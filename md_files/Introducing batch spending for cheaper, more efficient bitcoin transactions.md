### [Introducing batch spending for cheaper, more efficient bitcoin
transactions](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/170574017907/introducing-
batch-spending-for-cheaper-more)

One of the most requested features our users have recently been asking for is
the ability to combine (or batch) multiple unrelated spends into one
transaction. The benefit to creating these combined transactions is much lower
overall fees and more efficient use of the bitcoin blockchain.

Well, you spoke and we listened. In [version 0.97.35

will have the option of a selecting a new custom send type, "Batch Spend"

## Who is this useful for?

This feature is useful for any user who needs to make more than 1 transaction
in a given time period.

For example, if Alice needs to pay both Bob and Charlie, she can combine both
payments into one transaction, and pay one miner fee. Bob and Charlie get paid
as usual, and Alice just saved herself an unnecessary fee.

[ Samourai Wallet users are already paying the lowest transaction
fees](https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/960152335799504901) of any
other wallet, but now they can[

using our new Batch Spend feature.  

## Add transactions throughout the day. Spend when you're ready.

Another great use case for Batch Spend is low priority transactions. These can
be transactions to yourself or your friends, consolidation transactions, or
any transaction that is non urgent. Add transactions throughout the day (or
week, or month, or year!) to your Batch Queue which will remain saved until
you manually clear the queue or broadcast the transaction.

## What a Batch Spend looks like

Today, in anticipation of this update we asked our fantastic community on
Twitter to provide a bitcoin address. We then took the first 15 addresses and
created the a batch spend from Samourai on the bitcoin mainnet. [You can view
the transaction on our OXT block
explorer.](https://href.li/?https://oxt.me/transaction/5fec8d23cdb49d3c5d8e7c8550e2da1299afdfcd02de64714315c26765b0c5ec)

As you can see, we paid a total of 0.00003040 BTC  (roughly 20 cents, at the
time of TX)  to send to 15 unrelated participants. The transaction confirmed
within 7 blocks. Totally badass.

We hope you enjoy this update and the new functionality. Batch Spend is
available in the latest version of Samourai Wallet which can be [installed
onto your Android device from the Google Play
Store](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.samourai.wallet&t=NTVmN2UzZmY3ZjIwYjA3ZmQ3NzBlYzI1MzBiMTk0YmRkNmFmMTY2YSxTclIyejNjdA%3D%3D&b=t%3AgssRereQbaKEWqYj4_q6Mw&p=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.samouraiwallet.com%2Fpost%2F170574017907%2Fintroducing-
