After posting my [reassessment of Elon
Musk](http://www.konradsgraf.com/blog1/2017/7/22/hnbbsghwp2hf881mjakf4q2sjnxwh3)
yesterday, I saw that the initial responses were mostly positive and to the
effect that my reading seemed to be balanced and fair. A couple of interesting
issues and angles have come to my attention in the day that has followed.

One topic concerns whether the Tesla Model S is quite as great as some initial
magazine reviews suggested. Another is the narrative that Tesla could not
survive without subsidies, given the alleged phenomenon of "sales dropping to
zero" as soon as subsidies end. The third is a rather surprising turn—evidence
that Elon Musk has been speaking out _against_ electric vehicle subsidies and
that he has been promoting their abolition.

### Not so great?

A reader pointed out that _Consumer Reports_ , after initially reviewing the
Model S with glowing superlatives was then forced to remove the car from its
recommended list in late 2015. The reason was that poor reliability reports
were coming in. Things were breaking and needing fixing at a relatively high
rate.

I have seen superior assessments of the Model S on safety, performance, buyer
experience, total buyer maintenance cost, and service relationship. That is
quite a list of superlatives for an upstart company selling an entirely new
type of car. It is the safest car on the road. It has the fastest
acceleration. In doing all this, it is quiet. Actually, it can swim in flood
waters like a James Bond boat (the manufacturer does not recommended making a
practice of this though). In the area of service, Tesla employees show up at
people's homes to fix the car and then leave.

Reliability strikes me as just the sort of area that would depend most on
improvement over time through iterations of experience. Here we have a
completely new company with a completely new type of car up against century-
old companies building incremental advancements of century-old types of cars
(at least in comparing the Model S to conventional luxury sedans). My
prediction would be that the reliability issues should be steadily improving
as specific issues are identified and fixed and the company learns from
experience, redesigns parts, adjusts suppliers, etc. A small-scale version of
this phenomenon is why I never buy a new number release of an iPhone, but
always wait for the "S" version. Most major engineering issues are introduced
with the whole number redesigns and have been eliminated by the time the
upgrade iteration arrives. One can prioritize being first and taking on a
higher risk of issues, or wait until the earliest adopters have already served
as the Guinea Pigs. It is a matter of personal preference.

### Evidence quality behind claim of zero sales without subsidies

As for the narratives that no one would buy Tesla cars without subsidies,
here's one specific claim from a recent article: "After Hong Kong rescinded a
tax break for EVs effective in April, Tesla sales in April dropped to zero."

I have not researched or considered any detailed multi-country or up-to-date
data on this, but looking only at this one statement, it immediately occurred
to me that it is quite common for buyers of higher-end items or capital
equipment to be aware of the end or the beginning of major tax or subsidy
changes and then time their purchases accordingly. Even much more broadly,
sales always rise before a sales-tax increase, then drop off for some time
after the change takes effect. There is typically some degree of "sales rush"
leading up to such a change followed by a sales drop-off and eventually
normalization. The particular time scales depend on the specifics of the
product.

This makes me wonder just how much of this "sales dropped to zero" narrative
might be an artifact of such normal smart-buyer timing. The only surprising
outcome would be if buyers of $100,000 items would delay purchases until
_after_ an available discount was set to evaporate. To assess this, the whole
data series in each case, including well after the change in subsidy, would
have to be analyzed to account for this common factor in sales trend analysis.
Or one could omit such analysis, cite figures immediately after the end of the
subsidy, and thereby appear to have solid evidence for a subsidy-dependency
narrative.

### Does the alleged subsidy queen actually _want_ subsidies?

The final issue I found was actually quite surprising. With so many critics
painting Musk as a subsidy-seeking corporate welfare queen, I just sort of
accepted this as though it must be true. I know he is a deal-maker and seeks
out the best opportunities to acquire factory land, for example, and this
includes getting the best possible deals from governments. But does he
actively seek subsidies? According to the anti-Musk narrative, he _must,_
right?

Just before I found the information below, it had already occurred to me on
logical grounds that if some subsidies are of fixed amounts per electric
vehicle, which many are, they may well have been LESS important to Tesla than
to its competitor electric-vehicle makers (of course, this doesn't address the
advantage relative to FF vehicles). A $7,500 subsidy on a $100,000 car (Models
S and X) is 7.5% of the purchase price, the equivalent of a couple of options
more or less. This same subsidy on a $30,000 car is a 25% discount. True, the
latter case would now also apply more to the new Model 3, but this has not
been the context for these criticisms in the past.

Just after having this thought, a simple search revealed something I did not
expect to see at all:

At a May 2017 earnings call, Musk made the following statements:

> In fact, the incentives give us a relative disadvantage. Tesla has succeeded
> in spite of the incentives not because of them...Tesla's competitive
> advantage improves as the incentives go away. This continues to be something
> that is not well understood...

> I should perhaps touch again on this whole notion of—it's almost like over
> the years there's been all these sort of irritating articles like Tesla
> survives because of government subsidies and tax credits. It drives me
> crazy. Here's what those fools don't realize. Tesla is not alone in the car
> industry; all those things would be material if we were the only car company
> in existence. We are not. There are many car companies. What matters is
> whether we have a relative advantage in the market.

As Anton Wahlman [explained](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4069065-elon-
musk-begs-feds-please-end-teslas-tax-subsidy) (4 May 2017):

> Musk's argument is that the tax subsidies are worth more to Tesla's
> competitors than to Tesla, and that therefore Tesla would be better off
> without them, relatively speaking. Musk has made this argument in previous

> able to sell to other automakers as a purely politically engineered 100%

> a discount.

If removing subsidies removes a competitive _disadvantage_ for Tesla, this
might easily be written off as simply strategic self-interested promotion once
again. However, if we are engaging in a moral assessment of Musk the public
figure and claiming that he shamelessly seeks to live off the public purse,
his active opposition to electric vehicle subsidies still does not fit all
that smoothly into the anti-Musk narrative that I sought to qualify in my
recent post. In addition, it cannot have been lost on Musk that the end of EV
subsidies would also remove a special price advantage over conventional
vehicles, against which Tesla also competes.

Interestingly, Wahlman's article went on to explain why other automakers might
_also_ be happy to be free of EV subsidies—they come with expensive strings
attached.

> Elon Musk apparently looks forward to competing in a subsidy-free world (who
> knew?). But what about the other automakers? Wouldn't lower subsidies for
> electric cars mean fewer electric cars sold for them?..It sure would. And
> the other automakers would love it too!

> Why? Because under the current regime, they are manipulated by both the U.S.
> Federal tax code, as well as by California's ZEV mandate, to develop and
> produce more electric cars than for which there is true natural free-market
> demand. And that means billions of dollars in investment for products that
> they eventually have to dump at negative margins.

In writing my reassessment of Elon Musk, I suspected the anti-Musk narrative
to be a bit overdrawn, tending too far toward the negative in an imbalanced
way that does not do justice to the reality and tends to dismiss valid
positives in the sweep of also-valid negatives. The observations and
discoveries above now seem to indicate that the evidence and thinking behind
the anti-Musk narrative might be even somewhat weaker than I had been
suspecting. I think the ultimate point is to strive for a realistic and
nuanced assessment: to call the positives positive and the negatives negative
and acknowledge that both streams are present in parallel.
