# OXT will be listed on the Bitcoin.com Exchange

Aug 4, 2020  
  

OXT, the Orchid token, will be listed this Wednesday, August 5th at 10:00 AM
UTC on the [Bitcoin.com](https://exchange.bitcoin.com/) Exchange, a trading
platform that supports leading digital assets. On the exchange traders can
securely buy, sell, and invest in cryptocurrencies.

New Orchid users can open an account by purchasing at least $4 in OXT and $1
of ETH on the Bitcoin.com Exchange. Once the account is created, a shareable
QR code will appear that contains account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan
that account into the app for a simple, one-step setup.

Orchid's unique VPN marketplace uses a robust system of incentives to match
supply with demand and ensure ample bandwidth is available. Users use OXT to
fund their account, and can then purchase VPN service on a pay-as-you-go
basis.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid's Co-Founder and CEO said: "We are excited that
OXT is now supported by Bitcoin.com. Orchid's listing on this high-quality
exchange will allow even more people to access our decentralized VPN
marketplace and use the Internet with greater privacy. We look forward to
welcoming members of the Bitcoin.com community into our own."

> Especially during times like now, the importance of privacy cannot be
> stressed enough. Therefore, we're thrilled to support a blockchain company
> that combines Internet privacy with the benefits of a decentralized network
> and all of that in a user-friendly manner. We're looking forward to listing
> the Orchid token and can't wait to see where their journey takes them."
>
> \- Danish Chaudhry, Head of the Bitcoin.com Exchange.
