###  Authority and _ad hominem_

Argument from authority ("I'm the expert") goes hand-in-hand with the _ad
hominem_ ("you're not"). Each may be rebutted by the other, and the average
quality as evidence of arguments from authority are about the same as the
average quality as evidence of _ad hominem_. By necessity, these two kinds of
evidence are the dominant forms of evidence that lead each of us as
individuals to believe what we believe, since little important of what you
believe comes from your own direct observation. Authority's [investment
costs](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2012/08/proxy-measures-sunk-costs-
and.html) are one good proxy measure for evaluating the value of such
evidence. But contrast [the law of the dominant
paradigm](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/09/law-of-dominant-
paradigm.html). Perhaps the latter is superior for judging claims about the
objective world, whereas investment costs are superior for judging the
[intersubjective](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/tradition.html).

Did you ever reveal your theory about European exploration

Alas, my theory about exploration blew up in my face. Whatever happend is
likely more subtle than I supposed, and to fathom it will probably require
much more research, assuming enough documentation even exists to sort things
out.  
  
So you may see more about it, but alas no guarantees.

    "A premier thinker about history, law and economics, and the lessons they have for security." -- Adam Shostack, [Emergent Chaos ](http://www.emergentchaos.com/archives/2005/12/nick_szabo_blog.html)   
  
"Szabo comes out with these essays that leave me in awe." -- [Brian

"Like most blogs worth my attention, this blog is updated only infrequently.
That is because the authors of blogs worth my attention only post when they
have something to say that is true, relevant and not already known by their
audience. Most of the human race does not have the skill to know when an idea
has these three properties. The skill is particularly rare in the fields of
politics and economics, which is why this blog is such a rare and valuable
thing." \-- [Richard Hollerith](http://dl4.jottit.com/)
