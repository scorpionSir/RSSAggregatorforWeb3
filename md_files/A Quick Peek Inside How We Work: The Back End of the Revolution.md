## A Quick Peek Inside How We Work: The Back End of the Revolution

By [Joshua Long](/blog/author/joshua-long/)

¬∑

June 25, 2019

The main thing which we have talked about extensively on our blog is how our
outlook on the world intersects with the problems that we see with the current
technologies and structures that people interact with on a daily basis. These
articles serve an important purpose; they serve as a record of what we
believe, and allow us to give long-form, reasoned arguments for why we believe
this. But there is an aspect of AKASHA that we haven‚Äôt covered before, and
it‚Äôs one which is foundational, as it affects every member of the team on a
daily basis: how we work.

I joined the team in late March 2019, which as of the time of writing means
I‚Äôve been here for three months, and those three months have well and truly
opened my eyes to a new way of approaching collective action and creation.
Whether we‚Äôve been working in a nonstandard way for years, or we‚Äôre fresh out
of a cut-and-paste, top-down hierarchy where you turn up to your assigned
portion of the office each day and plug away for 7.5 hours with an hour for
lunch, we all share a fundamental belief that it is not just what we are
working on that is breaking new ground, but how we are organizing and
collaborating when working on it.

Breaking out of deeply-ingrained past work habits is a difficult thing to do,
but once you‚Äôve begun to untangle yourself from the outdated mode of working
that is still so pervasive in offices up and down the land, you begin to feel
lighter, and gain a greater sense of clarity and purpose.

> We shape our tools and afterwards our tools shape us - Marshall Mcluhan

There are many ways in which AKASHA differs greatly from your regular working
arrangement, but for brevity‚Äôs sake, here are just three key points:

## Remote First üåéüåçüåè

In a world where you can quite easily keep up with your friends in Hong Kong,
California, and Micronesia simultaneously in one group chat, necessitating
having your colleagues all come to the same place five days a week is a fairly
outdated concept.

The AKASHA Team is distributed all over the world; we build our processes
around the concepts of remote work by default, even though some of the team
members work together in offices from time to time. This means that the act of
building a team focuses more on the skills and values of the individuals
involved, and not their geographical proximity to your base of operations.

Remote first offers more flexibility and freedom, allowing people to perform
their job as best works for them. For me, this has meant being able to select
my working environment, visit friends all over the country whilst still
keeping on top of my workload, and avoid moving to a big city to find the
challenges and meaning that I want from work.

The workplace as we knew it is dead, the world is now your workplace, and with
it comes a lower environmental footprint, less urban overcrowding, and a
greater sense of freedom.

## Embracing Asynchronicity üïíüïòüïì

The spread of the team means that just because you‚Äôre up and ready to work, it
doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone else is! At AKASHA, we plan things well in advance
with the knowledge that everyone has different time zones, sleeping patterns,
and even working hours. At first this can be a difficult thing to get your
head around, and frequently group discussions to plan a meeting will carry the
weight of several people writing _‚Äú5pm which timezone?‚Äù_ One of the biggest
benefits of this is the difficulty, and therefore structural evasion, of one
of the most hated parts of modern office working: _the spontaneous three-hour
meeting._ Three hours of four people‚Äôs time is 12 hours of time that could be
allocated elsewhere, and having this kind of thing drop right into a busy day
can have a giant effect upon your ability to get things done.

Asynchronicity means being mindful of your colleagues‚Äô workloads, becoming a
better planner, and being more efficient with time. Just because you‚Äôre
working on GMT, and your co-worker is on +3, it doesn‚Äôt mean you are going to
be any less productive than if you were working in a synchronous organization.

## Doing Away With Internal Email üìßüëâüóëÔ∏è

This is by far the best part of the AKASHA workplace 3-piece puzzle, and is
intrinsically linked to both remote-first and asynchronous working. In order
to reach a goal together, in order to engage in the actual act of working as a
team, two or more people have to communicate in an iterative fashion; email is
not a tool conducive to doing this. Emails are a broadcast from one inbox to
another, they break up the natural flow of a working day, they lack
responsiveness, and they attempt to push people into unnatural ways of
communicating with each other. Working as part of an effective distributed
team means doing away with this medium, and moving conversations onto a tool
that is purpose-built for collaboration in teams. Another large benefit of
this is that you can very easily segment conversations depending upon teams
and topics, search for previous threads to fill in gaps in your understanding,
and pepper your output with as many emojis and GIFs as you like.

Ditching email means you no longer get the fear every time you press the send
button, you gain greater understanding of all those things you‚Äôre working on,
and you don‚Äôt have to change messaging mode every time you start work.

> _Any reality is an opinion, we make up our own reality - Timothy Leary_

## Building Upon This... üîßüß∞‚õèÔ∏è

As with everything at AKASHA, the rules which govern why, when, and how we are
doing things are constantly being tested and changed as we grow. We know full
well that we are not currently where we will end up, and our openness and
willing to try new things makes us very unique as an entity. These practices
are occurring in a world where a lot of people pine for more flexibility and
influence in the sphere of their life that they spend the majority of their
waking hours.

From my side, It‚Äôs inspiring to know that I‚Äôve found a group of radicals and
trailblazers whose mission is to change fundamentally how we approach the
structural and organizational ways that we create within, and interact with,
our world.
