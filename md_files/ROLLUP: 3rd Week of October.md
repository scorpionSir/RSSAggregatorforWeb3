WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

David: The dominoes seems to be falling faster and faster Markets, Charts,
news and releases all seem to align/resonate and this is one of those moments
I‚Äôve been more bullish BTC than normal, and more publicly bullish BTC than
normal (much to Sassals dismay) but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that when BTC
moons, ETH usually Moons 2x.

Ryan:

Long-term I think Bitcoin is second place on market cap (preparing the way) -
Bitcoin:  
\-- 2nd place in transaction fees  
\-- 2nd place in settlement value  
\-- 2nd place in transaction volume  
\- There‚Äôs not such thing as ALT: if you continue see the crypto world through
the lens of "Bitcoin" and the "Alts" you're going to get left behind. It's
2020, not 2015. Today there are: - Crypto capital assets  
\- Crypto commodities  
\- Crypto monies The same asset superclasses as old finance.  
  
WHAT ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT?  
David: Deposit Contract Hype! 1 ETH value accrual pillar to 2 pillars

Ryan: Projects launching directly on L2
<https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1318299374556975104?s=20>  
\- Honeyswap (on XDAI): [ https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/project-
spotlights/honeyswap](https://www.xdaichain.com/about-xdai/project-
spotlights/honeyswap)  
\- CircleUBI  
\- POAP  
\- minting directly on xDai then bridge to Etheruem
