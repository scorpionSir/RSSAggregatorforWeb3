## The Number 1 Challenge for Humanity - Cooperating at Scale, Part 2

By [Philip Sheldrake](/blog/author/philip-sheldrake/)

¬∑

August 07, 2020

 _Part 2 of 2._

In [the first](https://akasha.org/blog/2020/07/24/cooperating-at-scale-part-
one) of this two-part blog post I described why cooperating-at-scale is
humanity's primary challenge. Here I outline some candidate concepts and pre-
architectural principles to inform the necessary and sufficient
'sociotechnological primitives'.

First I'd like to qualify _pre-architectural_. It's not oxymoronic despite
_arche_ meaning _origin_ or _beginning_. Both physical and software
architecture originate structure and structural relationships, and we're not
yet at the stage to prescribe such things. Structure is ossified pattern and
our purpose at this early stage demands instead that we offer just a little
structure to open up the space to explore and nurture multiple patterns in
preparation for the emergence of multiple structural forms. If _pre-
architectural_ doesn't do it for you, then perhaps think of it as a parsimony
of design.

A means to [our purpose](https://akasha.org/about/) is the encouragement of
multi-disciplinary cooperation towards ever-improving multi-disciplinary
cooperation. At scale.

Nuclear physicists refer to the smallest amount of fissile material needed for
a sustained nuclear chain reaction as the critical mass. No-one can know the
variety or volume or patterns or structures of the methods, materials and
mindsets required to constitute a critical mass for cooperation-at-scale, but
perhaps your spidey senses are similar to our own ... maybe, just maybe,
assembling such critical mass is a possibility nearer, rather than further
away.

Here is an incomplete list of ideas and concepts that could well be in the
mix. At least they're at the forefront of AKASHA's collective mind, a mind
we're very much hoping to hook up to yours and your collectives' in the not
too distant.

## Both trust and trustlessness

The AKASHA team is excited to be working to combine the best of Web 3.0
wizardry and the best of human nature, nurturing and relying on the latter
where we can and as we should, and crafting the former as and when scale
demands.

Consensus protocols are predicated on either the absence of trust or a
contextual advantage of not having to establish it. Nevertheless, trust ‚Äî the
act of making oneself vulnerable to another ‚Äî is integral to human
relationships and community cohesion, and that has not and will not change.

The sociologist Niklas Luhmann put it plainly _[Trust and Power, 1979]_ :

> A complete absence of trust would prevent [one] even getting up in the
> morning.

Not exactly the outcome we're working towards here!

üí° For more on trust and trustworthiness we recommend Onora O'Neill's [A
Question of Trust](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p00gpzfq) (also available
[as a book](https://www.worldcat.org/title/a-question-of-
trust/oclc/838692803)).

## The viable systems model (VSM)

Developed by cybernetician Stafford Beer, the VSM represents an organizing
structure capable of (re)producing itself, of being viable in / adaptable to
the changing environment. It is useful to both analysis and synthesis.

Beer describes the isomorphic quality of the VSM, effectively its recursive
nature ‚Äî multiple viable systems constitute a viable system and so on ad
infinitum. So a group of people might constitute a VSM with any one person
fulfilling a System 1 role for example, but of course that person herself
constitutes a VSM.

The model is inspired by the brain and nervous system and consists of five
types of system. Systems 1, 2, and 3 are analogous to the autonomic nervous
system. System 4 encompasses cognition and conversation. And System 5 relates
to the higher brain functions involved in reflection and decision making.

üí° For more on the VSM we recommend Raul Espejo's [The Viable Systems Model: A
Briefing About Organisational
Structure](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Systems_and_Networks/Viable_Systems_Model/INTRODUCTION%20TO%20THE%20VIABLE%20SYSTEM%20MODEL3.pdf).

## Sociocracy (aka dynamic governance)

Conflict and passivity lie either side of sociocracy's goal. It's a form of
governance that welcomes and accommodates dissensus rather than consensus in
pursuit of productive and valuable outcomes.

Teams (known as circles) have autonomy with the consent of the wider
organization. A hierarchy of people is replaced by a hierarchy of roles, and
the organizational structure is forever poised to adapt as needed, per VSM.
Similarly, the structure has a recursive nature ‚Äî circles of circles, circles
within circles. You might call it holonic or fractal, and it serves to afford
scale without needing to scale the disadvantageous aspects of bureaucracy.

üí° For more on sociocracy we recommend [this introduction by Ted
Rau](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/what-is-sociocracy/).

## Platform cooperativism

Here is how Nathan Schneider [introduces the
topic](https://ioo.coop/2016/09/an-internet-of-ownership/):

"The disappointments of the online economy ‚Äì for instance, user surveillance
and systemic labor abuses ‚Äì stem at least in part from its failures to
meaningfully share ownership and governance with relevant stakeholders. Under
the banner of ‚Äòplatform cooperativism‚Äô, an emerging network of cooperative
developers, entrepreneurs, labor organizers and scholars is developing an
economic ecosystem that seeks to align the ownership and governance of
enterprises with the people whose lives are most affected by them. This
represents a radical critique of the existing online economy, but it‚Äôs also a
field of experimentation for alternative forms of ownership design."

üí° For more on platform cooperativism we recommend [Ours to Hack and to Own:
The Rise of Platform Cooperativism, a New Vision for the Future of Work and a
Fairer Internet](https://nathanschneider.info/books/ours-to-hack/).

Ted Rau again, [Platform co-op governance: deep democracy on
scale](https://medium.com/@JenRau/platform-co-op-governance-deep-democracy-on-
scale-c934f523b80e).

## Context and warm data

Context matters, as Gregory Bateson
[noted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_to_an_Ecology_of_Mind):

"There is a gulf between context and message (or between metamessage and
message) which is of the same nature as the gulf between a thing and the word
or sign that stands for it, or between the members of a class and the name of
the class. The context (or metamessage) _classifies_ the message, but can
never meet it on equal terms."

Essentially, "without context, there is no communication."

Our information technology is well suited to messages, and considerably less
suited to conveying context, let alone the metacontext of the sender or
recipient of the message. No-one would ever claim this facility of a so-called
smart contract and yet it is integral to human relations. Bateson's daughter
Nora [explains](https://www.warmdatalab.net/warm-data) why this is critical in
our context here:

"Information that does not take into account the full scope of
interrelationality in a system is likely to inspire misguided decision-making,
which compounds already ‚Äúwicked‚Äù problems. Warm Data is not meant to replace
or in any way diminish other data, but rather it is meant to keep data of
certain sorts ‚Äúwarm" ‚Äî with a nest of relations intact."

üí° For more on warm data we recommend [the International Bateson
Institute](https://batesoninstitute.org/warm-data/).

## Patterning and autopoiesis

You're good at patterns, as Jeremy Lent explains:

"Through the capabilities of our pre-frontal cortex, our species has evolved a
_patterning instinct_ ... It deserves to be called an instinct because it
emerges in human behavior at the earliest stages of development, well before
any cultural learning has taken place. ... This human instinct for patterning
is embedded in our cognition, maintaining its activity throughout our lives."

Our work should never ignore let alone erode this capability, but might in
fact seek to amplify it. Imagine for example if more individuals could see the
pattern that manifests as their so-called carbon footprint.

Fritjof Capra explains the _pattern of organization_ of any system as the
configuration of relationships among the system's components that determines
the system's essential characteristics. You immediately appreciate the pattern
that constitutes a bicycle for example, without contemplating the physical
structure of a specific bike. All bikes have the same pattern and every bike
has a unique structure.

Autopoiesis ‚Äî literally "self-making" ‚Äî links the _pattern of organization_
and _structure_ with the _process_ of embodiment in describing living systems.
The facilities for pattern-making, pattern recognition and sensing, and for
autopoiesis, are all front and centre in any ambition to cooperate-at-scale.

üí° For more on patterning we recommend Jeremy Lent's [The Patterning
Instinct](https://www.jeremylent.com/the-patterning-instinct.html).

üí° For more on autopoiesis, and much more, we recommend Fritjof Capra's [The
Systems View of Life](https://www.capracourse.net/).

## Community informatics

Community informatics design seeks practical solutions to complicated and
complex socio-technical challenges. It is necessarily transdisciplinary,
encompassing social and human aspects, life sciences, behavioural science,
organizational structures, systems design, management, ethics, aesthetics,
etc.

The following diagram portrays eight phases of patterns to be considered.

systems' design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-65373-0),

community informatics, and why does it
matter?](http://eprints.rclis.org/10919/1/WHAT_IS_COMMUNITY_INFORMATICS_reading.pdf)

## Developing patterns of organization

Where should we focus our attention if we wish to see structures emerging that
better support cooperation-at-scale? How might we offer up improved patterns?
How might we qualify them as improved at all?

In leading work on these questions at the Digital Life Collective, Joachim
Stroh maps out a territory:

[ ![patterns](/static/effa16a8d8707fada238e934bc307383/fcda8/patterns.png)
](/static/effa16a8d8707fada238e934bc307383/5a190/patterns.png)

## Ostrom's principles

Elinor Ostrom defined a set of principles that apply to the governance of so-
called common-pool resources ‚Äî those resources that are non-excludable (it's
impossible to exclude anyone from consuming the resource) and that feature
subtractability of use (akin to rivalrous, where my use reduces your potential
use).

The facilities to enhance cooperation should be available to all, so non-
excludability is right up our street. While many of the objects of cooperation
will feature subtractability ‚Äî see the Sustainable Development Goals ‚Äî the
facility for cooperation itself should be non-rivalrous if not anti-rivalrous.
In other words, my use of the facility increases the potential for and value
of your use, and vice versa.

üí° For more on the Ostrom principles we recommend Jeff Emmett's
[introduction](https://medium.com/commonsstack/automating-ostrom-for-
effective-dao-management-cfe7a7aea138) in the context of decentralized
autonomous organizations (DAO)

## Modular politics

We've been working towards our purpose for some time, considering the
expression and combination of elementary components of community governance as
Lego‚Ñ¢ bricks perhaps, or more accurately interactive bricks. We've recognised
those patterns of community and societal organization we might wish to
propagate (e.g. sociocracy) and, in the spirit of Buckminster Fuller, we're
also tantalized by the potential for these components to be assembled in
unprecedented combination to build new models that make existing ones
obsolete.

And then we stumbled upon the modular politics vision articulated this year
and drawing on Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD)
framework. The vision describes "a strategy ... specifying basic features of a
generalizable paradigm for online governance ... enabling platform operators
and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational
components that are modular, highly versatile in their expressiveness,
portable from one context to the another, and interoperable across platforms."

(Note: per the section above on context and warm data, portability between
contexts does not imply equivalence of meaning or effect from one context to
another.)

üí° For more on Modular Politics see [Modular Politics: Toward a Governance
Layer for Online Communities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13701.pdf), Primavera
De Filippi et al, 2020

## Identity

Identity is something that sets the individual and the group apart from other
individuals and groups ("show me your ID"). It is also something individuals
have in common, a similarity, a shared context ("I identify as ...").

The dynamics of identity work to differentiate and homologize at all scales of
organizing, recursively. Identity is then a critical aspect of all organizing,
of all cooperation, and yet the work to date on "digital identity" has been
incredibly narrow, mono-conceptual, and focused very much on repeatable and
reliable authentication by a computer system. This is not only inadequate when
taken to cover all conceptualizations of identity, it is dangerous. It does
not serve our psychology, sociology, or ecology well.

üí° For more on identity we recommend our own [Generative identity ‚Äî beyond
self-sovereignty](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/09/02/generative-identity-
beyond-self-sovereignty).

## Interpersonal data

The concept of "personal data" is elucidated in law, most notably perhaps the
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, very many people
conflate the legal definition for the real thing ‚Äî it's a very common mistake
to make. On the contrary, in the vast majority of instances the real thing
turns out to be interpersonal data i.e. describing or relating to a
relationship between two or more persons (including legal persons, aka
companies).

This is as deeply concerning for cooperation as identity, and that's because
identity, relationships, and interpersonal data are co-constitutive and
reciprocally defining.

Next time you hear someone refer to personal data, or "my data," ask them to
name some specifically and then you can respond by listing the other parties
necessarily involved (even if their context is entirely distinct). The phrase
"my data" conveys a declaration of ownership as well as connoting "data about
me." There is no property to be owned here, let alone any singular claim over
it. On the other hand "data about me" remains a valid concern for cooperating-
at-scale.

üí° For more on interpersonal data we recommend our own [The interpersonal data
at the heart of all human digital systems, including
markets](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/02/11/the-interpersonal-data-at-the-
heart-of-all-human-digital-systems-including-markets).
