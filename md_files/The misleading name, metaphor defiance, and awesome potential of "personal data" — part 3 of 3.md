[Read this post on
AKASHA](https://beta.akasha.world/#/0x872f8817ecf68ec4a5f940375a7900f9814da047/0x3c8dbbfe976a561279e14555ea89d3fd772df0b60bc1370a64bd47be3fb81024)

In the [first post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-
data-1-of-3) of this series I asserted that data is data. In other words, it's
not like anything else. The [second
post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/21/interpersonal-data-2-of-3) explored
and dismissed conceptualizations of data-as-property and data-as-labour. This,
the last post in this series, explores data-as-reputation, data-as-public-
good, and data-as-me, and then points to some architectural principles for a
new direction — interpersonal data.

## The problem of the way we frame the opportunity and problem

### Data-as-reputation

Rachel Botsman discusses reputation scoring in her book _What 's Mine Is
Yours_ ([check your library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/whats-mine-is-
yours-how-collaborative-consumption-is-changing-the-way-we-
live/oclc/1018435478)), and summarizes the opportunity in a later magazine
article:

> Imagine a world where banks take into account your online reputation
> alongside traditional credit ratings to determine your loan; where
> headhunters hire you based on the expertise you've demonstrated on online
> forums such as Quora; where your status from renting a house through Airbnb
> helps you become a trusted car renter on WhipCar; where your feedback on
> eBay can be used to get a head-start selling on Etsy; where traditional
> business cards are replaced by profiles of your digital trustworthiness,
> updated in real-time. Where reputation data becomes the window into how we
> behave, what motivates us, how our peers view us and ultimately whether we
> can or can't be trusted.
>
> Welcome to the reputation economy, where your online history becomes more
> powerful than your credit history.
>
> ... It's the culmination of many layers of reputation you build in different
> places that genuinely reflect who you are as a person and figuring out
> exactly how that carries value in a variety of contexts.
>
> The most basic level is verification of your true identity -- is this person
> a real person? Are they who they say they are?
>
> _[Rachel Botsman, Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/welcome-
> to-the-new-reputation-economy)_

There is nothing to dislike about the advantages touched upon here.
Unfortunately, like most things in life, the upsides come with downsides.

Programmatic quantification of reputation is an inevitable evil due to the
unavoidable self-moderation and modulation it inflicts on its subjects beyond
that which might be argued as 'good for society'. To be clear, the social
accretion of local, contextually-relevant reputation with forgiving
opportunities for reparation has served communities for millennia. We are
however considering universal, non-contextual and irremediable scoring and
algorithmic assessment. Mix in a naïve conceptualization of identity, as
inferred by the final paragraph of the quote above, and we will have excluded
from society anyone for whom identification is a question of personal safety,
and shackled the very [psychological change
processes](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/09/09/redirect-timothy-wilson/)
we all experience and rely upon.

Context is a keyword. I want to know if Alice is trustworthy to drive me
safely from A to B. I couldn't care less if she's up on her mortgage payments,
or has been dropping litter (I do care about that generally, but not in this
context), or has been 'dutifully' supportive of the current government, which
of course would be an abhorrent context here and one we must ensure we don't
engender accidentally. The introduction to Botsman's latest book, _Who Can You
Trust?_ ([check your library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/who-can-you-
trust-how-technology-brought-us-together-and-why-it-could-drive-us-
apart/oclc/1005641238)), does describe such an emerging system as this in
China as Orwellian, and warns that we're creating " _reputation trails_ where
one mistake or misdemeanour could follow us potentially for the rest of our
lives."

Some may think the GDPR limits such poor outcomes, but the regulation does not
give anyone the right to an explanation of automated decision-making for
example, and when algorithms feed other algorithms in complicated sequence
with dashes of machine learning for good measure, with its [inevitable
biases](https://medium.com/s/story/the-seductive-diversion-of-solving-bias-in-
artificial-intelligence-890df5e5ef53), a black box can be just as opaque to
its operators as to those on whom it operates.

We change ourselves, consciously and subconsciously, when we know we're a
subject of gaze — witness the '[selfie-
generation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bgq6dy)', poor bastards. And in
fact, if only a small coterie gets to set the associated algorithms, there is
[a massive potential abuse of power](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/political-
machines-9780485006346/).

PEN America, an organization that exists to protect open expression in
literature and related arts, [reported in 2013](https://pen.org/chilling-
effects/) that writers are engaging in self-censorship directly attributable
to their concerns about government surveillance, a system that inevitably
'scores' its subjects. Approximately a quarter of writers surveyed had
curtailed or avoided social media and had deliberately avoided certain topics
in phone and email conversations, and that's before the current President's
[Orwellian attacks on the media](https://www.theguardian.com/us-
news/2018/aug/13/united-nations-human-rights-nearly-impossible-to-defend-zeid-
raad-al-hussein).

If you resist censorship, it seems you must also resist reputation scoring.

Fortunately, we're not actually interested in reputation per se, only as a
proxy for trustworthiness and accountability. With some forethought we can
engineer our way around these challenges and avoid a
[Nosedive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_\(Black_Mirror\)). I suspect
the architecture will resemble the past in terms of our having to re-engineer
appropriate contextual and social frictions.

### Data-as-public-good

The title of Mariana Mazzucato's latest book strikes at the heart of my focus
here — _The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy_. The
book revisits her previous work, noting how much of the technology
underpinning the success of the dominant digital companies today was actually
funded by the state, e.g. the Internet, GPS, the touchscreen, voice
activation. She then expands on her grievance:

> Facebook's and Google's business models are built on the commodification of
> personal data, transforming through the alchemy of a two-sided market our
> friendships, interests, beliefs, and preferences into sellable propositions.
>
> _[Mariana Mazzucato, The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the
> Global Economy](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/280466/the-value-of-
> everything/), ([check your library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/value-of-
> everything-making-and-taking-in-the-global-economy/oclc/1007888201))_

Mazzucato believes the public should own its own data, not merely with the
possibility of selling it to the tech giants, but also to allow the public to
have more collective agency over its collective application for public
benefit. She is not a technologist so does not expand on the technical
architecture that might be required beyond namechecking big data and
artificial intelligence. As an economist she is considerably more cogent in
criticising the application of neoclassical economics to personal data, the
reduction of value to a market price, the market's inability to distinguish
between value creation and value extraction, and a dedication to the latter
leading ultimately to value destruction.

As Mazzucato concludes in an accompanying article:

> Only by thinking about digital platforms as collective creations can we
> construct a new model that offers something of real value, driven by public
> purpose. We're never far from a media story that stirs up a debate about the
> need to regulate tech companies, which creates a sense that there's a war
> between their interests and those of national governments. We need to move
> beyond this narrative. The digital economy must be subject to the needs of
> all sides; it's a partnership of equals where regulators should have the
> confidence to be market shapers and value creators.
>
> _[Mariana Mazzucato, Technology
> Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611489/lets-make-private-data-
> into-a-public-good/)_

Viktor Mayer-Schönberger advocates a "progressive data-sharing mandate".

> ... regulators wanting to ensure competitive markets should mandate the
> sharing of data. To this end, economists Jens Prüfer and Christoph
> Schottmüller offer [an intriguing
> idea](https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/15514029/2017_007.pdf). They suggest
> that large players using feedback data [essential to machine learning] must
> share such data (stripping it of obvious personal identifiers, and
> stringently ensuring that privacy is not being unduly compromised) with
> their competitors.
>
> ... Building on this idea, we suggest what we term a progressive data-
> sharing mandate. It would kick in once a company's market share reaches an

>
> _Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data
> ([check your library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/reinventing-capitalism-
> in-the-age-of-big-data/oclc/1020025487))_

Academics such as Mazzucato and Mayer-Schönberger see a deeper and perhaps
higher value in personal data than they believe the market can realise.

Similarly, in _Virtual Competition: The Promise and Perils of the Algorithm-
Driven Economy_ ([check your library](https://www.worldcat.org/title/virtual-
competition-the-promise-and-perils-of-the-algorithm-driven-
economy/oclc/982271790)), Professors Ariel Ezrachi and Maurice Stucke argue
that today's dominant players are in fact now freed from the market's
invisible hand. Indeed, one Silicon Valley businessman, Peter Thiel, considers
this an aspirational outcome when he spouts that "competition is for losers."

On reading a draft of this post, Elizabeth Renieris noted that the role of
regulatory frameworks, such as antitrust laws, shouldn't be under-appreciated.
They are core to Viktor Mayer-Schönberger's outlook. In a subsequent
conversation we noted that antitrust principles are
[founded](https://hbr.org/2017/11/as-more-people-worry-about-monopolies-an-
economist-explains-what-antitrust-can-and-cant-do) on ensuring consumer
benefit through competition. They typically focus on acts of monopolizing
behaviour rather than monopolies per se, where there is an actual or potential
consumer detriment. Many could argue however that the main centralizing, data-
hoarding companies have provided consumer benefit rather than detriment,
dismissing mere 'philosophical' concerns as raised here in the process. It
seems the application of such regulatory frameworks will first require their
revision, as indeed is under review in Europe — this 2016 Franco/German study
on _[Competition Law and
data](https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Publikation/DE/Berichte/Big%20Data%20Papier.html)_
for example.

In conclusion, I share the academics' concerns, but at the end of the day
market regulators can only regulate markets, and markets are dedicated to
property ownership. The [second
post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/21/interpersonal-data-2-of-3) in this
series already dismissed data-as-property.

### Data-as-me

In 2005, Professor Luciano Floridi pointed out that personal-data-as-property
completely fails to resolve some very real privacy concerns. Information
contamination for example, where our privacy is invaded by junkmail and loud
and intrusive chatter. In public contexts in which privacy norms still exist
without any concept of ownership — the right not to have the contents of your
packed lunch logged even though you eat it in plain sight for example. And
perhaps the most fundamental flaw in the data-as-property view of the world as
noted in [my previous post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/21/interpersonal-
data-2-of-3) — it's non-rivalrous.

Floridi offers up an alternative:

> Informational privacy requires radical re-interpretation, one that takes
> into account the essentially informational nature of human beings and of
> their operations as informational social agents. Such re-interpretation is
> achieved by considering each person as constituted by his or her
> information, and hence by understanding a breach of one's informational
> privacy as a form of aggression towards one's personal identity.
>
> _[Professor Luciano
> Floridi](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10676-006-9121-3.pdf)_

After all, we call a type of privacy transgression _identity_ theft. He
observes that digital technologies must then be developed to allow individuals
the opportunity:

> ... to design, shape and maintain their identities as informational agents.
> ... [and that] collecting, storing, reproducing, manipulating etc. one's
> information amounts now to stages in stealing, cloning or breeding someone
> else's personal identity.
>
> ... one's informational sphere and one's personal identity are co-
> referential, or two sides of the same coin. 'You are your information', so
> anything done to your information is done to you, not to your belongings.

This is an exciting vista. Nevertheless, it requires some modification in the
wei spirit (see the [first
post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-data-1-of-3) in this
series) to encourage the emergence of collective intelligence and our anti-
rivalrous flourishing.

How might we realise this value while respecting personal dignity and agency?
Indeed while respecting personal privacy, because what agency can anyone be
said to have if they cannot maintain personally desired and contextually-
appropriate privacy?

With some hope of bringing this three post series to a conclusion, I can at
least aspire to identify some qualifying architectural principles.

## Interpersonal data architectural principles

### Humans, not data subjects

You and I are not mere data subjects. Data is now integral to what it means to
be human.

### All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights

This is the first part of the first article of the [Universal Declaration of
Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/), and
harks back to Thomas Jefferson's [immortal
declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal). It must
be a core principle here of course.

### Interpersonal, not personal

This principle was presented in the [first
post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-data-1-of-3) of this
series, so I won't repeat the explanation here.

### Edge-centric, not node-centric

If you accept the reframing in terms of interpersonal data, then
architecturally the locus of our attention is shifted from the nodes to the
edges.

### Data is data

No pre-existing conceptualization or metaphor can be ported to our needs here,
and definitely not one based on a property paradigm. So wave goodbye to words
such as _my_ in the context of data ownership. But not _I_ , _me_ and _we_ in
combination — or indeed _wei_.

### Agency, not control

> Agency refers not to the intentions people have in doing things but to their
> capability of doing those things in the first place. ... To be able to 'act
> otherwise' means being able to intervene in the world, or to refrain from
> such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or
> state of affairs.
>
> _[Anthony
> Giddens](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cV8xnSIa0-IC&lpg=PA9&ots=Ay3cXl9p3d&dq=%E2%80%9CAgency%20refers%20not%20to%20the%20intentions%20people%20have%20in%20doing%20things%20but%20to%20their%20capability%20of%20doing%20those%20things%20in%20the%20first%20place.%E2%80%9D&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9CAgency%20refers%20not%20to%20the%20intentions%20people%20have%20in%20doing%20things%20but%20to%20their%20capability%20of%20doing%20those%20things%20in%20the%20first%20place.%E2%80%9D&f=false)_

Agency entails a negotiation in and with the world that the word control
appears to deny.

Sociologists appreciate that agency is unevenly distributed. Subscribing to a
humanist emancipatory ideal dedicated to human flourishing on top of a natural
self-interest in nurturing resilient living systems, one might want for
digital technologies and services to expand agency on the whole, attenuate
pre-digital constraints, and potentially spread it around a little more
evenly.

### Support posthumanism

Human beings are, of course, prioritized here over other person types (e.g.
corporates), and it is worth then considering what we mean by human being in
the digital age, specifically our digital augmentation as touched upon in the
[first post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-data-1-of-3)
when defining _person_. Norbert Wiener anticipated this informational, cyber
extension of ourselves way back in 1950!

> ... where a man's word goes, and where his power of perception goes, to that
> point his control and in a sense his physical existence is extended. To see
> and to give commands to the whole world is almost the same as being
> everywhere.
>
> _[Norbert Wiener, Human Use of Human
> Beings](https://archive.org/stream/NorbertWienerHumanUseOfHumanBeings/NorbertWienerHuman%5fuse%5fof%5fhuman%5fbeings%5fdjvu.txt)_

Two thirds of a century later it seems almost timid to (re)define the human as
biological, psychological, social, **informational** (i.e. 'personal data',
per Floridi, and interpersonal data), and **interfacial** (the application of
information for the self-sovereign sense-making of information, per the
[hi:project](https://hi-project.org/)).

In terms of the three levels of detachment referred to at the top of the
[first post](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-data-1-of-3) in
this series, Floridi observes that information technologies enhance the
corporeal membrane, empower the cognitive membrane, and extend the
consciousness membrane, but I would go further. The informational and
interfacial aspects of the human being may weaken the individualizing effects
of Floridi's three membranes by casting new complementary wei-shaped ones.
Once again, we're surveying a landscape first identified decades ago:

> Gregory Bateson has clearly shown that what he calls the 'ecology of ideas'
> cannot be contained within the domain of the psychology of the individual,
> but organizes itself into systems or 'minds', the boundaries of which no
> longer coincide with the participant individuals.
>
> _[Felix Guattari, The Three
> Ecologies](https://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Guattari%5fFelix%5fThe%5fThree%5fEcologies.pdf#page=35)_

The concept of _mind_ may be considered a consequence of our being social
animals rather than just _what 's in here_ [taps skull]. [Conceptualizations
of cognition](https://philarchive.org/archive/SMATCE-2v2) encompass the very
digitally-enabled information flows that are our focus here, enabling
embedded, embodied, extended, distributed and collective cognition.

### Differences, not absolutes

Given Bateson's definition of information as _a difference that makes a
difference_ , it would seem a little unnecessary to include this architectural
principle. Nevertheless, it's worth noting the broader potential value of
focusing on difference in the positive rather than negative (i.e. A minus B)
sense.

> We're all human. We're also all now on one worldwide network, and we need to

### Rhizomes, not trees

Deleuze and Guattari use the word _rhizome_ to describe theory that allows for
multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and
interpretation. They define it negatively in good part as not hierarchical,
not tree-like. This is an important assertion given how frequently tree-like
metaphors pepper our sciences, computing, and social constructions.

> ... unlike trees or their roots, the rhizome connects any point to any other
> point, and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of the same
> nature ... The rhizome is reducible to neither the One nor the multiple. ...
> It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or rather directions in
> motion. It has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle (milieu) from
> which it grows and which it overspills. ... Unlike a structure, which is
> defined by a set of points and positions ... the rhizome is made only of
> lines. ... In contrast to centered (even polycentric) systems with
> hierarchical modes of communication and pre-established paths, the rhizome
> is an acentered, nonhierarchical, non-signifying system without a General
> and without an organizing memory or central automaton, defined solely by a
> circulation of states.
>
> _[Deleuze and Guattari](https://www.worldcat.org/title/thousand-plateaus-
> capitalism-and-schizophrenia/oclc/1035451408)_

### Cache, not facsimile

A cache is a store of data solely for the purpose of serving future requests
for that data faster. Caching is integral to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for
example. On the other hand, I use facsimile here in the sense of a mere copy
of lesser import than the master record. You may have a facsimile of your bank
account transactions for example, but you would never expect your bank to
refer to your copy of events.

Note that the data is rendered into information — into valuable, actionable
insight — when data flows in combination. Flow does not require static
facsimile. Combination does not require isolated facsimile. Moreover,
facsimile will by definition never be master. I contend then that the concept
generally known as [personal data store](https://medium.com/@shevski/are-
personal-data-stores-about-to-become-the-next-big-thing-b767295ed842) (also
vault or wallet) is redundant before it's even made its way into the world.
Rather, we need insight into where interpersonal data is flowing and for what
purposes and with what consequences, entailing an interface into and onto the
permissions and flows.

Ultimately, if we get this right, your bank's cloud (should they continue to
maintain one, and should banks continue to be necessary to banking) will be
the facsimile.

### Information is simply complex

We are dealing with a phenomenon here that appears atomistically simple but in
fact forms, informs and infects everything. It's the original complex.
Identity is information. Relationships is information. Reputation is
information. Exchange is information. Organizing is information. Life is
information. We should then proceed with due caution — ethically and
technically. Ethically, we need to take appropriate time for due diligence.
Ethically, we cannot delay and allow the data-as-property protagonists time to
establish the mother of all Nash equilibria.

##  Please get in touch

A human being's subjectivity (our biases when it comes to perceiving and
assessing reality) may continue to emphasise itself, by which I mean _over_
-emphasise its self, but the rate at which information technologies transform
the interconnecting and interdepending is considerably greater than in the
context of the self alone — because that's what information technologies do.

We are each conscious as evolution has rendered sufficient complexity for such
phenomena to arise. The complexity in which we are bound may not (yet) be
conscious, but it is nevertheless inseparable. As we co-engineer sufficient
complexity in the flow of interpersonal data, we may develop the ecology of
mind required for a step change in wei's intelligence, and perhaps its
consciousness. Our co-development of regenerative planetary systems may depend
on it, and so the survival of our species and others.
