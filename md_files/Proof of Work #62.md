Good afternoon from sunny but ridiculously windy Boston.

When I found out about Bitcoin in 2013, it felt like stumbling into a parallel
reality. I grew up on a strict diet of cyberpunk scifi and it felt like
something straight out of a Gibson or Sterling book‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt stop reading
about how the protocol worked, how people were using it (shoutout
SatoshiDice!) and what effects it might start to have on the global community.

Since then, as FinanceBros and other establishment critters descended on the
space, a lot of what happened with Bitcoin was exciting to me an investor, but
frankly boring as a child of the Neuromancer/Snow Crash era of scifi.

In the course of exploring custody solutions for Primitive with Dovey, I
learned about Shamir‚Äôs secret sharing, an algorithm that allows you to take a
secret string of text and split it into m pieces, of which n are required to
reconstitute the original ‚Äúsecret.‚Äù Invented by Adi Shamir (the ‚ÄúS‚Äù in ‚ÄúRSA‚Äù)
in 1979, SSS is a time-tested piece of pretty simple cryptography, but it
enables a lot of cool things. The more I played around with it, the more I
wanted to use it as the basis for a game, an epic hunt for Bitcoin that would
be spread around the world.

Long story short, we assembled an amazing team, and yesterday [sent out the
first clue](https://twitter.com/notgrubles/status/1117819810702872576) (via
the Blockstream satellite, shoutout
[@grubles](https://twitter.com/notgrubles/)!) that kicked off a [global
hunt](http://satoshistreasure.xyz) for 1 million dollars in BTC. The response
has been absolutely overwhelming. People showed up to the 10 spots we
indicated around the world where keys would appear en masse‚Äîsome drove over 3
hours to get to a spot. Others figured out how to brute force the encryption
we used and solved the clues without having to travel (something which we
hoped would happen, but thought would take weeks‚Äîin reality it took 30
minutes..)

People are forming teams, talking strategy, speculating on the value of keys
and where the next clues will show up‚Ä¶ and our hypothesis that Bitcoin and
cryptography enable a new type of online/offline game experience seems to be
getting validated. Subreddits are being created. Telegram groups are forming.
Our poor mongoDB is getting hammered with signups. We‚Äôre all a bit exhausted
after this first day, but we‚Äôre also incredibly excited to see what people do
with the next set of clues.

Small housekeeping update: we now order PoW updates by EricRank, a proprietary
algorithm that produces an ordinal ranking based on how interesting Eric finds
a given update. It‚Äôs prone to false negatives, but it feels better than the
old way where some of the coolest projects (Hi OpenBazaar! Maker! Sia!) are
permanently relegated to the bottom of the update. Let me know if you guys
like this better, or prefer the old format.

More next week, thanks as always for reading.

#### **China & Asia Updates**

 **Mining üî®**

  * Bitmain S19 (53T) sold out in 4 mins. However, some believe this was a show to make it appear as though it was in high demand. The actual sales number is unknown 

  * Whatsminer launched their flagship M20S (68T) the same day in Shenzhen, expected shipment around July 

  * The so-called ‚Äúmining ban‚Äù last week does not impact ANYTHING on the ground, period. [ _ed: dovey tells it like it is_ ]

  * $LTC hashrate hit ATH before, while $BSV continues to drop. Network hashrate is the only security guarantee for a PoW coin, and a clear indicator of where miner confidence lies. $LTC has a very strong miner community in Asia, second to $BTC

 **Trading üí∞**

  * The biggest bank in Japan, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, started the trial of its [yen pegged stable coin ](https://www.ccn.com/japans-biggest-bank-to-carry-large-scale-trial-of-cryptocurrency-mufg-coin)‚ÄúMUFG coin‚Äù last week. Over 10k of its banking customers participated in the trial 

  * It‚Äôs said that over half of the newly issued $200M tether were distributed to Chinese traders through a few local brokers [ _ed: I also heard this independently, seems likely_ ]

 **Regulation** **üöß**

  * Many lending or OTC desks in China which turned out to be Ponzi schemes are now on the verge of blowing up, so be careful if you are dealing with any 

  * China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) urged further investigation into illegal fundraising activities involving cryptocurrency and other commonly used concepts. The use of cryptocurrency is common in local ponzi schemes. A formal legislative bill will be out in a few months. But to be honest, I rarely see any regulatory action from China impact the macro crypto market, unless it plans to fully legalize crypto and revert what it banned before

 **Misc ü§ì**

  * Star Xu, the founder of OKEx, stepped down as the legal representative of OKEx‚Äôs operating entity in mainland China. Doing so sort of de-risked himself from any criminal charges that might be lobbied towards OKEx on the mainland 

  * Tencent launched a Pok√©mon Go -like LBS game called [‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hunt the beat together‚Äù](https://trustsql.qq.com/chain_oss/game.html) powered by its blockchain platform TrustSQL to enable gaming features similar to CryptoKitties 

**Korea**

  * Government regulation continues to stifle exchanges by blocking new customers from making fiat deposits to exchange accounts. Korean companies are also not allowed to deposit to exchanges for fear of money laundering.

  * Crypto-collateralized lending is considered to be a banking service and thus restricted, so it has not been as active in Korea as it has in the US.

  * Any sort of crypto derivatives trading is illegal. In the past, Coinone tried to launch a 4x BTC token and it was banned.

 **JZ from Decred**

 _Decred  is an autonomous digital currency with a hybrid consensus system. It
is built to be a self-ruling currency where everyone can vote on the rules and
project-level decision making proportionately to their stake._

  * It's happening! [Marco has released his proposal outlining a DAE](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) (Decentralized Autonomous Entity) that would have full control over the Decred project treasury. To protect against a wide variety of attacks there will be a two-fold process needed to release funds; a draft spending proposal will need to be signed by a Politeia identity key (off-chain) followed by the stakeholders approving the transfer through a vote (on-chain) much the way consensus votes are effectuated. Some more details were provided in an interview with Marco that was [published by Invest in Blockchain this week](https://www.investinblockchain.com/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-decreds-treasury-proposal-closer-true-dae/).

  * We're psyched to be hosting our second [San Francisco Decred meet up on April 18](https://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Decred-Meetup/events/260046546/). Coinbase has been gracious enough to provide a venue for us, and Decred dev Luke Powell will be giving a talk on governance and funding in Decred, followed by a seminar on the broader topic of cryptocurrency funding models.

  * The [March edition of the Decred Journal](https://decredcommunity.org/blog/decred-journal-march-2019) is out. This issue marks a year of amazing work by bee the editor who manages the journal, and who a few of us suspect might actually be a small team of anonymous contributors.

  * On the Politeia front, the stakeholders authorized a [budget to fund integration work for Trust Wallet](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571). As it turns out the Trust Wallet team has already completed most of the work. If someone is looking to cut their teeth on a Go project relating to Decred and earn some coins in the process we're looking to have a dev do the final piece of the integration which involves adding Decred support to [Trezor Blockbook](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook). We're always looking for motivated devs so don't hesitate to [reach out](https://www.decred.org/community/).

 **David from Sia**

 _Sia is a decentralized cloud storage platform leveraging blockchain
technology to create a data storage marketplace that is more robust and more
affordable than traditional cloud storage providers._

  * Release Progress: 1.4.1: The Sia team and various community contributors have been squashing various bugs in Sia and Sia-UI including bugs around file renaming, memory leaks, and using the `siac` utility.

  * Community contributor geo-gs got an interesting bit of code merged in to Sia this week. His Merge Request titled ‚ÄúAdd Genesis Siacoin Allocation‚Äù sets up Sia to be more easily forked from the genesis block for use in other Crypto projects supporting an Airdrop. Just to clarify, this is a fork of Sia, and Sia is not airdropping any coins; this MR simply makes it easier to fork and airdrop coins for projects based off Sia.

  * Nebulous is hiring for 5 new positions. Check them out [here](https://angel.co/nebulous/jobs).

  * Community member tbenz9 [wrote a blog post](https://medium.com/@tbenz9/securing-sia-wallets-renter-and-hosts-17a020d8b86b) on how to secure your wallet, renters, and hosts.

 **Coulter from MakerDAO**

community governance._

  * We have another testnet release for Multi-Collateral Dai. A full rundown of what's been updated can be read [here](https://blog.makerdao.com/update-the-road-to-multi-collateral-dai-kovan-release-v0-2-3/). 

  * We have introduced a DIY Meetup program and micro-grants initiative. If you're a fan of Maker and want to meet with others in your region to talk about Dai, [check it out.](https://blog.makerdao.com/makerdao-global-meetups-and-micro-grants-initiative/)

  * Announced upgrades to the Maker Ecosystem Foundation [structure.](http://structure./)

  * At The Bold Awards, we won Best ICO/Cryptocurrency (though we never had an ICO so we'll focus on the latter). 

  * Dai is now [integrated](https://medium.com/originprotocol/pay-with-dai-on-origin-announcing-our-first-stablecoin-integration-43f86d5d7982) into Origin Protocol, allowing you to pay for goods or services with our decentralized stablecoin. 

 **Arnaud from AZTEC Protocol**

 _AZTEC Protocol is an efficient zero-knowledge protocol built on top of
Ethereum, making plug-and-play value transmission and asset governance privacy
tools for developers and companies.  _

  * Last week we officially started the first of our two audits. During our prep run, we reached 96% test coverage, and fixed a couple of important bugs.

  * This week, we are working on 2 new proofs: **public range proofs** and **private range proofs** , which allow AZTEC assets to test whether an encrypted balance is worth more, or less than either a public balance or a private balance.   
This is used for assets which have minimum/maximum notionals for trades, or
maximum/minimum ownership requirements for asset holders.

  * This week we've also started work on the trustless post-processing step of our trusted setup. We'll be publishing more information soon.

  * We‚Äôre still hiring for two cryptographers to join the team. You can apply [here](http://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUEuOwyAMPU3ZNSKQpGHBoq1mrhHxcVumBEfgTJU5_RBF8sKy_fw-zhA8MW96wUJsLZCn4LVQgg8t87rz7diPLJTpkQFmE6KmvAJbVhuDMxQw7fe9kuylwUnVg3RcXQYu7eDAenvpjOx5Lweh2M4xmdUHSA40_ELeMAGL-kW0lJO8nsR3LZOeEBuHe_tH4M5LRkKH8Szr6AdtYUEL3iouRcs7LjvRtM2NX-_jnY-3QbS37ut66vj8FE1ZbSHj3vXfzLI2OVUBdecy-EBzSNQEPJTRtoBO8CkRiCAzOkKpXqcKntcUaJsgGRvB6wNSvUt1kQOrNB5rPklXsfjAxwfz-x-f0nXk), or by emailing [arnaud@aztecprotocol.com](mailto:arnaud@aztecprotocol.com) with the name of the role as the subject
