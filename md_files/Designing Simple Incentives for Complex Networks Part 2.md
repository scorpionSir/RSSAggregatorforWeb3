## In previous posts, we discussed the [importance of stakeholder mapping and
creating a taxonomy of actors](https://outlierventures.io/research/the-
importance-of-stakeholder-and-value-mapping-in-token-ecosystem-creation/), and
setting your network’s [objective
function](https://outlierventures.io/research/design-phase-of-token-ecosystem-
creation/). These steps set a strong macro foundation for starting to build
out specific incentives across your network, but now the focus turns to the
microeconomics of specific roles within your network.

More and more networks are emerging with increasingly complex sets of
participants, network roles, and incentive mechanisms. As we have pointed out
in a previous post [Analysing Incentives for Arbitrage and Market Maker
Keepers in MakerDAO](https://medium.com/outlier-ventures-io/incentive-
analysis-arbitrage-market-maker-keepers-in-makerdao-20b3e2fd12db), designing
incentives needs to be approached role by role to ensure that key network
roles are properly incentivised. As networks start to compete for adoption, a
key indicator of success will be how well the incentives on the network can
overcome initial switching costs and bootstrap user adoption and traction.

But how can you ensure that your token design and incentive structures can
overcome these initial switching costs? Being able to build a business case
not just for a network as a whole, but for specific roles within the network
is key. In our post on [Arbitrage and Market Maker Keepers in
MakerDao](https://medium.com/outlier-ventures-io/incentive-analysis-arbitrage-
market-maker-keepers-in-makerdao-20b3e2fd12db) we built a static business case
showing simulated returns for these keepers over a fixed time window. The
objective of any incentive design should be to build up to a business case for
specific roles within the network. This exercise is useful for comparative
analysis between other networks and can help a designer create attractive
opportunities for potential network participants. Building these static
business cases can ensure roles are initially attractive and help drive early
adoption. But what about long term traction?

In reality, these business cases are very dynamic with multi-agent
interactions and continuous games being played. For example, as discussed in
[Philip Daian’s paper Flash Boys 2.0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf),
arbitrage agents compete in gas auctions in a front-running competition with
other agents to get their transactions executed first. Other complex
behaviours have emerged such as arbitrage agents arbitraging the cost of gas
over time to help fund their gas auctions to front-run their pure token
arbitrage transactions. The point is that as these networks are launched,
incentive economics will evolve as more complex behaviours emerge, some good
and some bad. To understand these emergent and sometimes unplanned behaviours,
game theory, mechanism design and behavioural economics are particularly
useful tools.

**GAME THEORY**

Game theory is the study of multi-person decision problems and a crucial tool
in the token design process since it helps us determine the outcomes from
strategic interaction of players given their preferences and incentives.
Unlike decision theory that is concerned with the individual’s own preferences
and constraints, game theory is about interactive decisions and shows us how
players can make decisions in competitive and/or cooperative environments.

In our MakerDao Keeper example, Game Theory can be used to model out these
business cases in terms of multi-agent games to determine potential
equilibrium gas prices and revenue.

**MECHANISM DESIGN**

Mechanism Design is the art of designing the rules of a game to achieve a
specific desired outcome. While game theory takes the rules of the game as
given and helps us determine outcomes based on them and the strategic
interaction of players, mechanism design uses the framework of game theory
with incomplete information and asks about the consequences of different rules
and chooses the game structure rather than inheriting one. Therefore, in our
context, mechanism design allows us to look at the overall design of the
network and participants’ incentives as a way to influence the outcomes of the
network game in addition to determining the optimal design of the network
itself.

For our MakerDai Keeper example, Mechanism Design is very helpful lens to
analyse Ethereum’s gas model (auction mechanism) and can help identify
potential solutions to the risk presented by front-running.

**BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS**

Behavioural economics studies economic questions while incorporating learnings
from psychology, and experimental economics. Psychological findings have shown
us that human beings have limited cognitive abilities, lack motivation and
self-control. Additionally, their preferences, choices and behaviour maybe
non-standard, meaning human beings may not always behave efficiently, and in
fact, their behaviour may change based on a reference point, as well as the
context they are in. This means that the way the token’s functionality is
presented to participants is perhaps equally important as the actual
mechanisms themselves.

For our MakerDao example, Behavioural Economics is a useful lens to uncover
the preferences of individual Keepers operating on the network. Keepers are
autonomous, but their actions are pre-coded by developers and are
representative of the developer’s unique set of preferences. Although the
source code can be hard to obtain, analysing a set of Keepers behaviour over-
time can help uncover the range of preferences present on the network, and can
help design more targeted mechanisms.

**PARTICIPANT INCENTIVES**

As mentioned before, incentives aim to induce network participants to act in a
particular way in an economic or business setting and hence play a crucial
role in any economic or contractual relationship. In a setting where
participants in the network have differing goals and possess varying degrees
of knowledge, optimal allocation of resources and mutual gains are only
attainable with the right design of incentive mechanisms.

One should denote that, participants can partake in the token ecosystem either
via interacting with each other at the market layer or by becoming nodes to
sustain the ledger layer, or both. Relying on correct assumptions about the
possible types and designing the right incentives matter at both those layers.
Accordingly, it is important to remember the rationality level of different
types of participants in the network can vary greatly (for example,
rationality of AI versus different types of individuals may differ
significantly) and its effects on the ecosystem should be tested or simulated.

**DESIGNING FOR ATTACK VECTORS**

Token models are dynamic complex systems that produce unpredictable
(stochastic) and predictable (deterministic) outcomes. The issue is that many
of the (Nash) equilibria determined in the design phase using the economic
lenses described above are simply proofs of existence and in practice, this
does not mean that a particular state will actually be the outcome in real
life.

What is important to flag is the set of possibilities within any given model,
not the likely equilibrium. By knowing what is possible, as opposed to
focusing on what is likely, the token architect can then eliminate the
possibility of certain behaviours, and limit the action space. By knowing the
set of all possible actions, also known as the action space, the designer can
then focus on incentive engineering efforts only towards those states which
are possible.

**OTHER APPLICATIONS**

This general approach of incentive design can also be a very useful lens for
designing consensus mechanisms and token distribution strategies. For
consensus mechanisms knowing the business case for a miner, and how miners
compete for rewards over time can help uncover potential attack vectors
leading to better incentive structures that support efficient network
operations. Similarly for token distributions, knowing the preferences of
potential token purchasers (something that is easier said than done!) can be
instrumental in developing a distribution strategy that gets tokens into the
hands of the right people.

As a closing thought, it is important to build up from simple incentives to
more complex incentive structures only after observing real network
behaviours. In the case of MakerDao, Keepers were first managed by the
MakerDao team internally. It was only relatively recently when sample
codebases for Keeper roles were made open source, and the number and
variations of Keepers within specific roles exploded. Since then Keeper
behaviour has become much more complex but has also made the system more
robust. Complexity naturally emerges from simple states so keep it simple
initially. It is important to design incentives that already exist. You can't
force behaviours but you can incentivise them.
