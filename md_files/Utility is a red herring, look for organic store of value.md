# Utility is a red herring, look for organic store of value

Store of value properties is what gives crypto networks value, utility is
overrated for the purposes of investment appreciation. **Utility is a red
herring for investors.**

In the case of Bitcoin, its real utility is really just a bucket, it's a
bucket to store value. Make no mistake that the majority of asset value in the
world is derived from players parking value into an asset for storage. Whether
that be a house, a lump of gold, or even, to a lesser extent, stocks.

To hit this home in crypto... the rise of ETH was _NOT_ from utility. It was
_NOT_ from users buying ETH to get Gas to fuel smart contracts. It was from
ICO token treasuries parking their funds in ETH as a store of value.

Unfortunately for ETH, the ERC20 contract that opened the pathway for ETH as a
store of value was inorganic. It forced ETH as the token to raise funds. It
seemed good to keep funds in ETH as ICO mania pushed values up as more and
more projects parked their treasuries in ETH. Easy up equals easy down.
Treasuries bailed ETH cascading it down.

Despite being a red herring, utility attracts usage. In a way, through the
eyes of the investor, this utility is merely marketing exposure. It opens an
opportunity for the network to be used as a store of value. But without solid
store of value properties in the network, the network won't sustain high long
term capital appreciation apart from short term noob fueled bubbles. Or what
we saw with ETH.

What gives a network good properties for store of value? I like [Murad
Mahmudov's](https://twitter.com/MustStopMurad) prioritised framework of:

(1) Security  
(2) Credibility of fixed monetary policy  
(3) Liquidity / [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) /
Infrastructure / Ecosystem  
(4) Governance / Adaptability / Community / Game Theoretic Robustness  
  
I can rewrite this as:  
(1) don't break on me  
(2) don't cheat me in the future  
(3) bring more money in  
(4) look after the above

(1) (2) and (4) are often discussed. (3) is not deeply studied enough, these
network effects are key.

No other crypto-asset has the liquidity, Lindy Effect and infrastructure close
to Bitcoin. Ethereum is a clear second, but fails on (2).

Many projects try to bootstrap (3) by employing market makers to stimulate
liquidity. They also market the impression of a growing ecosystem with MOUs of
partnerships. This is all hot air. Look for organic growth, it's the hard
yards that matter.

For example, an investor should be careful regarding organic liquidity versus
inorganic liquidity. The former is a sign that real people are using the asset
as a store of value, organic liquidity is a by-product of people entering and
exiting the asset. A good way to check this is comparing on-chain volumes.
Real entries and exits are reflected on the blockchain, market makers do not
clear funds onto the chain. If the liquidity is organic, then it means you can
exit when it's time to reallocate capital to other buckets. If it's inorganic,
the market maker may quit and you're left high and dry.

(1) (2) and (4) are usually objective, (3) is often faked. Look deeply into
(3) and make sure the network effects are true and here to stay. Look for
organic store of value properties.

## Supply Shock, predicting price by quantifying intent to buy and sell

IntroductionIn any market, price is driven by demand and supply. This is a
fundamental. The most obvious way of seeing this is in the bid and asks
