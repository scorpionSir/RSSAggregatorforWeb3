35 - Designing Ethereum | Vitalik Buterin

With Ethereum 2.0 on the horizon, we bring Vitalik Buterin back onto the
podcast to discuss the 'why' behind many of the design choices of Ethereum 2.0

Why Proof of Stake? Why Sharding?

We also go over what has been discovered and added between the 2015 launch of
Ethereum 1.x, and where we are now, such as  
\- EIP1559  
\- Rollups  
as well as Vitaliks view of a 'rollup centric Ethereum'

We also discuss the process going getting Ethereum 1 onboarded into Ethereum
2.0, as well as a rollup-round where we ask some quick questions!
