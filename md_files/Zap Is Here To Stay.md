# Zap Is Here To Stay

Yo. **_Today I am thrilled to finally publicly reveal Zap has closed a $3.5M
seed round with some amazing strategic partners in both Bitcoin and
payments_**.

This company has been through it all and has an incredible story. What started
as an open-source project in the basement of [Bitcoin
Mom‚Äôs](https://twitter.com/bitcoinmom) house has turned into something much
bigger. We started with building one of the most popular open-source non-
custodial Lightning wallets, and recently we released our flagship product
[Strike](https://beta.strike.me), a first of its kind Lightning native neo-
bank.

# The Story

Back in 2017, [I wrote a Medium article announcing
Zap](https://medium.com/@JimmyMow/announcing-zap-a-lightning-network-
wallet-47622acd89fb), a Lightning Network wallet for the community. The driver
was simple: I love Bitcoin and in the midst of a scaling war, I wanted to help
Bitcoin. In order to help I decided to work on Lightning. More specifically I
wanted to make Lightning relatable, usable, and easy to conceptualize. I
wanted to show the world that Bitcoin was going to scale on layer two and
achieve our hopes and ambitions as a community, all without the need to
compromise the very characteristics that make Bitcoin valuable.

Here are some funny photos. My parents and I when I first began coding, a
selfie I took in my bed when writing the first lines of code that started Zap,
and a picture my best friend took of me (who now works at Zap) hacking on the
first versions of what would become Zap on my couch üòÉ

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2052/1*gkLjhH59knuMWuzlwVSQjQ.png)

Since then, Zap has become one of the most popular open-source, non-custodial,
Lightning Network wallets. After a few years of having a front-row seat into
the scaling of this asset class and this new emerging protocol, I began to
learn how and why people were using Bitcoin with Lightning. It was a budding
new use case. Users weren‚Äôt speculating on the asset class and weren‚Äôt
necessarily prioritizing privacy or censorship resistance. All of a sudden,
Bitcoin was being used as a payment rail to physically settle value globally,
instantly, and for extremely cheap.

So, I sketched the beginnings of what is [now
Strike](https://medium.com/@JimmyMow/announcing-strike-by-zap-4f578c7c8984) in
my hotel room in Paris, in the fall of 2019. Here is the initial Strike sketch
from my notebook and a selfie I took with Mona Lisa that same day.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2484/1*DlSH-7LgPz4c_DhCJwfH0g.png)

Fast forward to today, Zap is now the home to 13 unbelievably talented people,
and we work on Strike every single day, across six countries. [We‚Äôve recently
released Strike publicly in the US](https://medium.com/@JimmyMow/announcing-
strike-public-beta-325877a79f87) and since our July 2nd public BETA launch, we
have thousands of active users and will process well into six figures worth of
volume in the month of July alone.

It‚Äôs been a wild ride. So many people doubted us, turned down investing, told
me my ideas weren‚Äôt going to work, and that I couldn‚Äôt build something
meaningful without a college degree. I look at [my 2017 Medium
article](https://medium.com/@JimmyMow/announcing-zap-a-lightning-network-
wallet-47622acd89fb) as a thesis of sorts that explain the foundations of my
approach to Bitcoin, product design, etc. But one point particularly sticks
out to me today.

In my initial 2017 Medium article, I wrote:

> Lightning Network has become quite the buzzword recently, especially with
> the lock-in of the highly anticipated upgrade segwit. With the hype, I have
> received some attention from investors and potential business partners
> interested in Zap. I have respectfully declined all offers.
>

> follow incentives that misalign with the broader community and its users
> because they are beholden to their initial business model and/or their
> outside investors. This creates an unhealthy relationship between their

> users and their experience.

In a lot of ways, I still believe this statement to be true. Yes, we took in
capital, but that capital exists to scale our services to more people. Strike
is a service that addresses pain points for mass adoption, and Zap exists to
serve, well, everyone else. The two exist as polar opposite services that
complement each other in terms of the audience they address. Bitcoin is who I
go to war for, nothing more, nothing less. This is why this financing process
has taken me years. Up until recently, my family and I self-funded this
project out of my bedroom to ensure we do what is best for Bitcoin and this
community. Post-funding, none of this changes.

# Hiring

Over the years, Zap and Strike have become bigger than I ever could‚Äôve
imagined. I was a kid when I got involved with Bitcoin. I couldn‚Äôt have dreamt
the seven years since. Today, I am so excited and proud to have found the
investors and partners that allow me to scale Strike and Bitcoin to the world.
I can‚Äôt do this alone, and now I don‚Äôt have to. We‚Äôll be growing every aspect
of the business, from the team, to the products we offer, the partners we work
with, and the markets we operate in.

I am actively hiring to expand our offerings into other markets and other
product spaces. We have new Strike features, [a Strike card in partnership
with VISA](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-startup-zap-is-working-with-visa),
Strike rewards, Strike merchant tools, and more coming in the near future. If
you love Bitcoin, are a good-hearted human, and are extremely talented, I will
hire you on the spot. I‚Äôd also like to make a point here, if you feel as
though you are unqualified, find solace in the fact that this motley crew
(terrible band I'm sorry) of fine people is comprised of those that have never
graduated high school to those with multiple masters degrees. We hire talent.
We hire ambition. We hire passion. There are no prerequisites to work here.
Those are the only things I look for. If you‚Äôre interested in working on
Strike with me, shoot a note to jobs@strike.me. We have a lot of work to do,
and we need your help getting it done.

# Thanks

I‚Äôm pretty speechless. It‚Äôs an emotional day for me. I joined this community
when I was 18. While my childhood friends were rushing fraternities and
tailgating at university, I was on r/Bitcoin shitposting big blockers. You all
helped raise me. This is my alma mater.

It feels like I blinked and am living a dream. I‚Äôm contributing to a
technology, an idea, and a movement that I believe will change the world. I
mean, you‚Äôve got to be fucking kidding me, how cool is that? If I were to live
the last seven years of my life over again, I‚Äôd be sitting right here, writing
this blog post. It‚Äôs days like today that have me jumping with excitement
about the next seven years and beyond.

Thanks to everyone that supported this journey. I am forever in debt and
beyond grateful for everything this community has done for me. Bitcoin has
changed my life in ways I could‚Äôve only dreamed.

The future will be fun, you now know I‚Äôve got so much more coming for years to
come.

As always, much love fam. Talk soon ‚ù§Ô∏è üçª
