## A deep dive into the world of Distributed Governance

By [Martin Etzrodt](/blog/author/martin-etzrodt/) & [Mihai
Alisie](/blog/author/mihai-alisie/)

¬∑

February 08, 2019

We celebrated the new year by revealing [the new AKASHA Foundation
website](https://akasha.org/) alongside the first
[metamorphosis](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/15/akasha-2019-metamorphosis-
part1/) post outlining how the AKASHA project will evolve from its early
experiments to a non-profit foundation exploring the intersection of
blockchain and collective intelligence.

üôå 2019 here we come! üôå

We then followed through with a three-part series introducing interpersonal
data and, before January ended, we also participated in three very meaningful
events focusing on various aspects of distributed governance. A field of
crucial importance, especially during this time as the crypto space is
maturing.

This post covers the events we participated in through the lenses of two team
members, Martin and Mihai.

We hope you enjoy it!

### Berlin calling: DGOV & ARACON.ONE

_Martin Etzrodt, Berlin, January 2019_

Hello everyone! My name is Martin Etzrodt and I recently joined AKASHA to
support the Team‚Äôs research efforts. I decided to join the project taking a
side-step from my academic career after I realised the potential ‚Äúself-
sovereign‚Äù communication media like the AKASHA dapp can have to fundamentally
accelerate the way we may organize to solve problems at a global scale. I will
write more about my past and how it relates to my current work in a dedicated
blogpost.

In this post I would like to reflect on the past days I spent in Berlin
attending the [Distributed governance (DGOV)](https://wiki.dgov.foundation/)
community council and the [Aracon.one](https://aracon.one/) conference. I
would also like to express my deep appreciation, on behalf of the AKASHA
Foundation, for the teams that organised these two events. It was an amazing
experience filled with great people and bold ideas.

Delegates of all trades gathered in Berlin to discuss both the technical and
human aspects that we need to get right to enable the kind of efficient,
large-scale coordination of organizations that distributed technologies make
possible.

While blockchains provide the backbone, coordination protocols that can be
built on top of them, also referred to as decentralised autonomous
organizations (DAOs), will enable distributed human cooperation and
collaboration on a global scale.

There are still many challenges we need to solve. However, the foundations
towards future types of organizations using platforms like
[Aragon](https://aragon.one/) and censorship resistant tools for communication
such as [AKASHA](https://akasha.world/) are being rolled out in 2019.

Aron Fischer (researcher at [colony.io](https://colony.io/) nicely pointed at
their future utility during a panel at Aracon.one:

> ‚ÄúThe hope of course is that the tools evolve to the point where we can solve
> the huge global problems that we as a society have trouble addressing with
> our governmental and business institutions as they are today. These are
> coordination tools around common shared goals and there are really some big
> and shared goals that everyone would like to be working on, but doesn‚Äôt know
> how to start and I think the excitement of DAOs is that it is really easy to
> just start and then develop an internal dynamic momentum to grow things, to
> keep projects going forward without needing permission upfront."

Beutel)._

In a positive scenario for ‚Äúthe future of work‚Äù we may be empowered to
dedicate time to multiple projects we feel strongly about. We will be able to
make valuable and meaningful contributions to those different projects instead
of being confined to work on a single one in a traditional hierarchical form
of business organization. We may transcend as individuals the need of
attaining a specific role in society that likely does not encompass the full
potential nor permit self-fulfilment of the individual.

As the technology evolves, we need to prevent undesirable dystopias though.
The technology we create may be an ever more efficient means to enslave us. It
is thus important to design governance not too rigidly - and allow the DAO
code to evolve in a transparent manner - and let DAOs die, if necessary.

After all, it is crucial to define systems with a human-centric focus in mind.
Therefore, I am especially thankful for the work of the DGOV organizers Tim
Bansemer, Max Semenchuk, Anja Blaj and Aeon Hochberg, supported by an amazing
facilitation team comprised of Phoebe Tickell, Lucas Tauil de Freitas,
Francesca Pick (all [Enspiral](https://enspiral.com/)) and Ela Kagel
([Supermarkt Berlin](https://supermarkt-berlin.net/en/)).

Their truly groundbreaking approach to organize a ‚Äúcouncil‚Äù, instead of a
traditional conference setting, created a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù in which I believe
everyone of the 50 participants was able to have their opinion heard, learn
from each other and then really go deep on complex topics in a truly
interdisciplinary way to debate questions including identity, global
democracy, ‚Äúcode as law‚Äù (see also attendant Vlad Zamfir‚Äôs
[article](https://medium.com/cryptolawreview/against-szabos-law-for-a-new-
crypto-legal-system-d00d0f3d3827) published just the day before the council)
or the rise of the dystopian ‚ÄùMega DAO.‚Äù

_‚ÄúProperty for sale‚Äù - as the end of establishment and centralised form of

Philippe Honigman, one of the DGOV attendees, stated that on many topics the
prevailing

> "Lack of clarity [‚Ä¶] is not necessarily a bad thing as there is diversity.
> It calls for creation.‚Äù

Thanks for capturing [this sentence in a
Tweet](https://twitter.com/theobtl/status/1089910106018467840), Theo Beutel,
researcher at the [GIZ Blockchain
Lab](https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/67045.html) and
[Bundesblock](https://bundesblock.de/), who introduced me to this wonderful
community.

Looking ahead, 2019 will become an interesting ‚Äúyear of the DAO‚Äù as several
platforms and experiments (such as [Aragon](https://aragon.org/) evolve and
the [DutchX DAO](https://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be launching.

As the 500+ participants of the first Aragon community conference return home
to spread the word about the rise of DAOs, I am confident Aragon will
contribute and I agree with Aragon executive director Stefano Bernardi who
said: ‚ÄúI've never seen a concept with more killer apps than DAOs.‚Äù

## The other side of the coin: from Crypto Valley to Crypto Nation

_Mihai Alisie, Davos, January 2019_

During January, we participated in another great event this time in Davos,
Switzerland, organized as part of the World Economic Forum 2019. The House of
Switzerland hosted an invite-only, blockchain-focused event where Swiss
government representatives and blockchain entrepreneurs had the opportunity to
interact and gaze together into the future.  ![House of Switzerland
Tweet.](/static/2aba4fb5c68bd11194c223f443a8fb49/79e1b/house_of_switzerland_tweet.png)
State Secretary for International Finance Matters
([SIF,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Secretariat_for_International_Financial_Matters))
JoÃàrg Gasser opened the event outlining Switzerland‚Äôs overall blockchain
strategy. To sum it up, Switzerland seeks to nurture a legal environment
encouraging innovation, is open to new ideas and does not want to ‚Äúbox‚Äù
blockchain in a particular regulatory category. Big applause from the
audience.

[ ![JoÃàrg Gasser delivering his opening speech on Switzerland‚Äôs role in the

_JoÃàrg Gasser delivering his opening speech on Switzerland‚Äôs role in the new
blockchain landscape._

For some context, SIF defends Switzerland's interests in international
financial, tax and monetary matters. It promotes international
competitiveness, the integrity of Switzerland's financial centre, access to
foreign financial markets and the stability of the Swiss financial sector. In
order to pursue its objectives, SIF performs the following functions:

  * Representation of Switzerland's interests in financial and tax matters vis-√†-vis foreign countries
  * Safeguarding of Switzerland's interests in influential bodies such as the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund) and the [Financial Stability Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Stability_Board)
  * Participation in international efforts to combat financial crime and terrorism
  * Analysis of financial market developments in Switzerland and abroad
  * Further development of financial sector legislation

All in all, it was very encouraging to hear such a strong and positive
statement from an official representative of the Swiss government - especially
when the main focus of the governmental body represented handles such delicate
matters in the bigger picture.

The stage has been set. My talk followed next.

Since I coined the name ‚ÄúCrypto Valley‚Äù during one of our first meetings with
the Economic Development team of Zug in early 2014, I was invited to give a
presentation on the genesis of Crypto Valley and some of the lessons learned
in the process of founding Ethereum Switzerland. During this presentation I
reflected on the first ‚Äúblockchain decade‚Äù and how Crypto Valley emerged in
this new landscape, concluding with an attempt to explore what the next
blockchain decade might bring.

[ ![Mihai talking about the genesis of Crypto Valley and Crypto
Nation.](/static/5b8c4d60d8a7ae0448cc5f5e39d88d06/1c72d/Davos_WEF19_MIHAI_012019.jpg)
](/static/5b8c4d60d8a7ae0448cc5f5e39d88d06/4c618/Davos_WEF19_MIHAI_012019.jpg)
_Mihai talking about the genesis of Crypto Valley and Crypto Nation._

The first part of the talk highlighted the progression from the initial
decentralized digital currency experiment and single use-case blockchains
introduced by Bitcoin over 10 years ago, to the idea of programmable digital
currencies and general purpose blockchains introduced by Ethereum 5 years ago
and how this process expanded our initial understanding from blockchain having
a single purpose and use case, to blockchain being more similar to an app
platform.

The second part of my talk aimed to explore some of the trends that formed in
this first blockchain decade and how they will impact the next one. During
this part I also made a connection between the original ‚ÄúCrypto Valley‚Äù idea
and how it later evolved to ‚ÄúCrypto Nation‚Äù in the mind of Switzerland‚Äôs
former President, [Johann Schneider-
Ammann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Schneider-Ammann).

I took this opportunity to point out how ‚Äúnations‚Äù and ‚Äúsocieties‚Äù, represent
mental constructs built on top of a set of shared agreements between
individuals (for example at a traffic stop we ‚Äúknow‚Äù that green light means
‚Äúgo‚Äù, red light means ‚Äústop‚Äù) and how the monetary part is just one of the
many agreements that we humans, take for granted most of the times.

In this paradigm, ‚ÄúCrypto Nations‚Äù could deploy an explicit set of rules
(constitution/protocol) with the institutions and companies becoming the
equivalent of ‚Äúapps‚Äù connected by the agreed-upon protocols through which
citizens can interact, vote and collaborate via cryptographically secure
mechanisms with increased efficiency, transparency and self-sovereignty.

This was an interesting moment in which the room seemed to take note how, even
though we are surrounded by so much technology today, we are still operating
as a society using the best ideas from ~200 years ago, with paper documents
and hand signatures representing a glimpse into a different age and time.

The presentation concluded with a connection between the way web apps
currently work via APIs and how, in the near future, we might see an
equivalent emerging but for programmable organizing - with DAOs being just one
early example of how this might unfold.

In this context, the next blockchain decade points to an increased importance
of interoperability and standardization, alongside a shift of the main focus
from the infrastructure layer to the applications layer and connecting the
dots under a bigger umbrella of programmable social operating systems.

The takeaway points included how Switzerland is very well positioned to
innovate in this areas considering how ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù [is already in its
DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland) combined with an
understanding that blockchain technology can mean more than just
cryptocurrency, followed by a call to continue pushing forward in search of
solutions that can radically improve the current state of things beyond just
‚Äúmoney.‚Äù

The presentation was well received, followed by questions and an intriguing
invitation to expand these ideas in a book. The rest of the event was focused
on **how** rather than **if** to become a ‚ÄúCrypto Nation‚Äù and the challenges
ahead.

Some of the highlights included a need for more developers in the space,
better education on the blockchain topic, and a call to ‚Äúdare to think BIG‚Äù by
Mathias Ruch, founder of the CryptoValley Labs & Board Member of the Swiss
Blockchain Federation. Overall, we are very happy with the results and we left
the event feeling optimistic about what the next blockchain decade will bring
to Switzerland and the world at large.

In the bigger picture, if the [Aracon](https://aracon.one/) and the
[DGOV](https://wiki.dgov.foundation/) events were pointing to how groups of
all sizes from small communities to big nations will be transformed by this
new technology, the House of Switzerland event was the other side of the coin,
pointing out to the genesis of the first Crypto Nation(s) and a new playing
field.
