Hi everybody! My name is Gabriel Golcher. I am a UX Designer living in
beautiful Austin, Texas and I joined AKASHA this week as Head of Design!

**I also have zero experience in crypto.**

Yes, you heard me right. _I am an outsider!_ ... and that‚Äôs a good thing,
believe it or not.

My initial experiences have been eventful enough to motivate me to start a
blog series documenting my immersion in the culture, language, and world of
crypto (with an Ethereum tint). We‚Äôll experience together the challenges non-
dev newbies like me face in becoming a part of this community. I‚Äôll also call
out UX challenges I observe from an outsider‚Äôs perspective. Finally, we‚Äôll be
able to track how I start becoming a deeper part of the community and
gradually develop a more-refined crypto UX perspective (which I‚Äôll share in
this blog with all of you).

All in all, we‚Äôll have a good record of the issues I‚Äôve faced. My hope is that
I can become a case study to help identify challenges the mainstream will face
in turn as they move to Web 3.0 (I hope I employed that term correctly üòâ). If
my work makes crypto as a whole more approachable, easier to use, and more
palatable to the majority of people, I‚Äôll consider myself successful.

So how has my first week been? Harder than expected! **I‚Äôve been more of an
ethnographer and less of a UX Designer.** I‚Äôve had to learn about a new
culture, a new language, and a new way of thinking.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Take a look at this tweet that a member of the team shared:

> A new Gnosis Safe App is live!
>
> Users can now trade ETH and ERC20s straight from their multisig using
> [@1inchexchange](). 1inch achieves the best market rates by splitting orders
> among multiple DEXes in one single transaction. üîíüîÑ
>

>
> ‚Äî Gnosis Safe (@gnosisSafe) [Jul 8,
> 2020](https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1280894399782633472)

They were all discussing it like normal while I was totally lost; it may as
well have been in a different language! I had no idea what ERC20s, multisigs,
1inch, or DEXes were. Actually, I still don‚Äôt know what a bunch of those terms
mean. üò≥

Something similar happened when I started diving in, reading about gas,
tokens, a weird way of logging in with a wallet, etc. I found myself
consistently lost and requiring a ton of handholding from the team (yay
team!). Without their help I literally would not have figured how to log in to
the various Ethereum sites. Also, I still don‚Äôt fully grasp decentralization
to the extent crypto takes it, or the duality between private and public, but
I‚Äôll get there. ü§Ø

In UX terms, I‚Äôve started scratching the surface. I‚Äôve found novel, creative
ideas that don‚Äôt usually do a good job identifying and understanding their
target user or mapping out their customer journey. As a result, many sites and
dapps are hampered by hard onboarding, absent first-time experiences, complex
and unapproachable terminology, and bewildering flows (making a purchase is
_next to impossible!_ ).

**But I‚Äôve also found something much more inspiring and captivating: this is a
community that really cares. Y‚Äôall care about empowering people to be
themselves, democratizing data, and championing privacy.**

**_That‚Äôs_ why I am here, and I‚Äôm thrilled to be taking this journey with you.
‚ù§Ô∏è**

Please share with me any challenges you‚Äôve faced becoming a part of this
community, where it can improve and grow, and what aspects of it we should
retain and emphasize. Also, if you have any suggestions of articles or videos
for me to learn more, I‚Äôd be very grateful (a coworker suggested [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVZxjVJz4ds) which was hilarious and
also very informative). Finally, any resources on crypto UX are always very
welcome!

Thank you all, it‚Äôs a real pleasure!
