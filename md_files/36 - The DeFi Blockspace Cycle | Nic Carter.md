36 - The DeFi Blockspace Cycle | Nic Carter

Nic Carter recently released an article titled "Public Blockchain Fee
Cyclicality and Negative Feedback Loops"...

... simplified "transaction fees get higher, and that incentives people
transact less, and then that lowers transaction fees and that incentives
people to transact more"

According to Nic, there's no equilibrium found upon public blockchains with
inflexible block size; the demand to purchase blockspace will always be
volatile, across all time frames.

Another perspective: constraints on blockspace availability dramatically
impacts the kind of usage that is feasible to happen on the base-layer
blockchain.

Transactors who are transacting large transactions will pay for higher fees!
This severely impacts the markets that are supported by public blockchains!
Constraints on block space are constraints on market participants!

David, Ryan, and Nic go through Nic's process is disecting the data that
created these conclusions. Nic gives his perspective as to the ultimate
pattern that emerges from this data.

David reads Nic's article aloud on the Bankless YouTube! Useful for listening
to the episode!
