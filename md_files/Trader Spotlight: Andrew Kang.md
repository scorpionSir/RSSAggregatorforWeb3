> This is episode **#02** of Trader Spotlight, a series on trading insights &
> strategies used by well-known cryptocurrency investors.

On May 14th, we hosted a live AMA Spotlight with [**Andrew
Kang**](https://twitter.com/Rewkang). Andrew has a wealth of expertise in
crypto through prop trading, venture investing, mining, and more. He has his
hands in almost every corner of the crypto markets!

In these AMA spotlights, our goal is to bring you the best insights and
commentary from professional crypto traders, market makers, and leading
industry experts!

Below is a recap of the AMA with [Andrew Kang](https://twitter.com/Rewkang).

For crypto, my first real exposure was probably in 2013. It was around the
point when Dogecoin first started and it was blowing up on Reddit which I
frequented. The fervor around Dogecoin was real and what was interesting was
that a "Dogecoinmarkets" subreddit where people bought Dogecoin OTC also
emerged. The thing was that people were bidding 2x-3x over market price since
most didn't have access to coinbase/onramps.

I didn't either at the time, and Coinbase applications were taking days/weeks
to approve + long banking transfers, so what I did was find a sketchy website
that accepted credit cards + instant BTC purchases to start arbitraging the
Dogecoin BTC markets. Made maybe $5k in a two weeks which was a lot for me at
the time in college until the arb started to go away

Asia is such a big market and I think all of the countries have their own
different sentiments, but I'll focus on China which is the largest. From my
friends there, the sentiment seemed to be bearish/neutral on this entire
runup. Many miners and traders got really wrecked on Black Thursday, so they
weren't sure there would be new buyers in this market. America seems to really
start to pick up on BTC as a SOV and the Paul Tudor Jones news is resonating a
lot.

Also, I'll say that it's interesting that Okex and Huobi futures curves have
consistently been more backwardated. My suspicion is that miners are now being
a lot smarter about hedging than previously as black thursday was a huge slap
in the face, but haven't validated this widely yet

The markets are definitely related to each other and there are going to be
traders out there that interact with all 3. For those, we are going to be
constantly reevaluating what trades offer the best yield, and where the best
R/R trade is if directional. Borrowing rates are usually a reflection of the
opportunities in the futures markets for basis trades.

Good question. I'm not sure I am the best person to answer this as I know
there are a ton of trading funds in deep China that pop up all the time and
most of us have never heard of. Many of which are trading with sizable
capital. I think generally they use a lot more leverage. I know of two western
funds that blew up on Black Thursday, but many more large punters in China
that blew up then.

A lot of the same analytics products are popular with them! I see skew,
tradinglite, etc. screenshots whenever I pop into those chinese wechat groups.

Converting from BTC to wBTC has a lot of friction right now - it took like 1
hour + a lot of fees + slippage last time I did it, but a lot of projects like
Ren & Thorchain have apps in development to turn this into a 1 step process
which will alleviate a lot of friction.

You can read more about my thoughts on the tradeoffs of different tokenized
BTC projects here:

Also what's interesting is that the supply of wBTC pretty much doubled in one
day on May 13th.

USDT supply has definitely been exploding. I think generally it's the
arbitrageurs (including OTC desks) and not the holders/users of USDT that are
doing the actual depositing. Combination of OTC desk, miners, businesses, and
normal people. In Asia, you see USDT being used for cross border remittance
alot, and even some traditional import/export businesses are making it a
standard part of their business. Main advantages are faster & cheaper
remittance, and also tax evasion for some businesses in Asia.

I use USDT & USDC in everyday life. Financed a hand sanitizer bottle
manufacturing business opportunity in Indonesia by sending USDT and having a
local OTC desk convert to IDR. Invested in a US based Biotech by sending USDC
to VC friend that led the deal

The excitement over DeFi is growing pretty quickly. Hard for many of us to see
since sites like DeFipulse.com tend not to track asian defi projects. dForce
was $20M+ TLV before the exploit, imBTC almost overtook wBTC a few months
back, and I remember Rune Christiansen even saying that China was surprisingly
their largest market for CDPs when they did analysis on web traffic data.
Tokenion DEX (on imToken) gets some substantial volume from what I remember -
surpassing many DEX's we've heard of in the west.

I think perps will still be dominant and their volumes will grow since delta =
1 is just easy to understand, but options definitely have a lot more room to
grow. In legacy finance, options:futures volume is something like 2:3 and in
crypto, options volume is only low single digits % of futures/perps

From the market makers I've tracked, it looks like they are market making
across multiple DEX's. E.g. Oasis in addition to dYdX. The books are obviously
not as liquid as CEX's and the infra to market make is not as easy to set up
yet and the whole DeFi thing is still relatively new compared to Crypto CeFi.
Whenever a market is new & inefficient, there's opportunity. Even some of the
older DEX's that have OK volume still have really wide spreads.

>  **Would love to get your thoughts on what kind of token models and growth
> hacks you have seen as effective for bootstrapping liquidity/early users.**

Generating value for token holders while bootstrapping network growth is
definitely the most important balance to strike for token projects. I think
previously you saw a lot of token models detract from the network more than
they added to it, but models these days are getting a lot better.

What's interesting are the token models that essentially provide subsidies via
token inflation for network participants that contribute positively and where
their actions result in network effects. E.g. Kava & Synthetix.

Synthetix sETH pool becoming the largest Uniswap pool (1/3 of total Uniswap
TLV at one point) is a testament to the effectiveness of the model. Made it
100x easier for people to go in and out of synths.

I think the two important factors that DeFi has over CeFi is:

1\. Composability

2\. Regulatory Arbitrage

People tend to focus on self custodial finance as something really important,
but I think that's overplayed and the market for that is small. Projects whose
only differentiator is the self custody aspect have generally failed to get
any traction. The fact that these decentralized financial systems are able to
interact with each other using the same database allows for a lot of
interesting things though. For say JP Morgan & Apple to collaborate on a
financial product, it's extremely friction heavy, but is seamless in DeFi.

Regulatory arbitrage is also huge. And will be even more important when
regulators crack down harder on crypto exchanges. It's why Bitmex, deribit,
etc. have started to be more restrictive recently. Right now, its difficult
for most US people to trade crypto options for example, but they could always
use DeFi apps as a get around.

>  **How does contango/backwardation affect your trading strategies?**

From a directional trading standpoint, deep contango or backwardation is one
of the indicators that can tell us if we're overextended or not in one
direction. There are a lot of yield generating strategies you can take
advantage of when curves are in contango/backwardation.

> **Do you think USD Tether should be supported more in DeFi?**

This will probably make some people mad, but yes. It's an order of magnitude
more liquid than USDC/DAI and there's obviously demand for it. Look at how
quickly the USDT pools in Aave and Curve grew once they were added and that's
all you need to know about the demand

>  **What's better... a 30% return in a bull market or a 30% return in a bear
> market?**

30% in a bear - the majority of people aren't generating any returns in a
bear. But bull/bear markets are starting to look less like past ones (i.e.
black thursday) since we are seeing a secular change in crypto markets in
general, so be careful out there!
