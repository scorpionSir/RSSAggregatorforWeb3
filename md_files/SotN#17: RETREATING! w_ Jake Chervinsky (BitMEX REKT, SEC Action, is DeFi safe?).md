SotN #16: RETREATING! w/ @jchervinsky (BitMEX REKT, SEC Action, is DeFi safe?)

Lots of legal action taken against the crypto world lately! We're bringing
Jake Chervinsky from Compound Labs onto the show to help us understand what's
going on.

\- Enforcement actions from the SEC and CFTC  
\- SALT Lending pays fine, must return investor funds, must register token  
\- Kik is official dead, slain by SEC  
\- BitMEX got BitREKT  
\-- CEO Arther Hayes 'is AT LARGE', CTO of BitMEX is in jail

**But most importantly:**

Is DeFi immune from this?  
Does the protocolization of financial instruments save the day?  
When the spotlight turns to DeFi, are we prepared?
