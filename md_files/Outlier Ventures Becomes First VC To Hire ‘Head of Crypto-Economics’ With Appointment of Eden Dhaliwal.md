[Outlier Ventures,](https://outlierventures.io/) one of the World’s leading
blockchains and Web 3.0 venture capital firms today announces it has bolstered
its capabilities in token offerings. This is in response to the explosive
growth of ICOs, commonly referred to as initial coin offerings, which has seen
the issuance of tokens by open source communities overtaking venture capital
as a primary means of capital raising.

Eden joins their growing Toronto office alongside Head of Corporate
Structuring & Compliance, Greg Murphy, that was setup to work with a network
of leading global law firms and tax advisors to support their portfolio in
token design and issuance. Outlier plans to execute three ‘community economy
token offerings’ in the remaining part of 2017, after six months of planning,
to realise a new standard of compliance and economic design to attract
institutional grade investment and become some of the first corporate backed
token offerings the industry has seen.

‘Crypto-economics’ refers to the combination of cryptography, computer
networks and game theory to secure systems to realise a set of economic
incentives or disincentives. The emerging discipline is based on the belief
that these crypto-communities are building entirely new economic models that
will increasingly dominate The Web.

Jamie Burke, Founder & CEO, Outlier Ventures commented:

> _“The focus all too often of token offerings is solely to bypass securities
> laws and raise large amounts of capital, quicky. At Outlier we take the
> responsibility of how issuances are technically executed very seriously.
> Similarly we believe these communities are building the next phase of The
> Web so proper time and thought should be invested in how these new digital
> economies are designed to ensure their long-term sustainability.’’_

He continued:

> _‘’Eden has spent the last year performing some breath taking analysis of
> the various token models out there and brings a wealth of valuable venture
> experience to help us explore the emerging discipline of crypto-economics
> for the benefit of our present and future portfolio as well as the community
> at large’’._

Dhaliwal recently established Slant Labs with various Canadian Government
agencies to experiment with new innovative Blockchain business models and use
cases. As an experienced venture manager, he has been deeply embedded in
Blockchain for several years previously designing several tokens ahead of
issuance for DLT Labs, a Blockchain consultancy group. Leveraging this
experience Dhaliwal’s primary focus will be leading Outlier Venture’s select
group of premium ‘Community Token Offerings’. He will focus on the token
design process and assume overall oversight of various token campaigns,
working directly alongside Jamie Burke.

A ‘community token offering’ is an innovation pioneered by Outlier that
enables a collective of start-ups and partners to jointly issue a token for a
shared protocol within a meta theme, through a structured offering. Parties
commit code, know-how, users and in some instances licenses, to rapidly enable
‘MVC’, or minimal viable community, in order to quickly form an open source
crypto community and gain network effect.

Eden Dhaliwal, Principal, Outlier Ventures added:

> _“It’s such a new space that no one can claim to be an expert but together
> with the Outlier team, a group of people I have followed with great respect
> for some time, I feel we can really contribute to taking community driven
> tech to the next level.”_
