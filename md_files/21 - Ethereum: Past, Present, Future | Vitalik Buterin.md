Episode: #21  
July 13, 2020

Ethereum turns 5 on July 30th! That's 5 years of history. Five years of
progress. Time enough to change the world?

We sit down with Vitalik Buterin and walk through Ethereum's past, present,
and future. Has the vision changed? Has ETH earned its price? What about
monetary policy? How's Vitalik feeling about the future?

Is ETH a triple-point asset?

It seems clear that Vitalik believes the Ethereum community is its strongest
asset. This band of Athenians isn't just here to vanquish foes, it's here to
build a digital civilization for the world. Not burn it down. Build it up.

Vitalik believes crypto is standing strong as one of the few remaining things
that's genuinely international. And as we witness the balkanization of the
digital world, the open door to cooperation that Ethereum provides is exactly
what humanity needs in order to thrive in the 21st century.

Happy 5th Birthday Ethereum!

The world needs you now more than ever.

We cover:

  * How Vitalik's feeling about Ethereum
  * PAST: 
    * Times when Vitalik was far less optimistic
    * Has Ethereum matched the original vision?
    * Identity in an independent digital civilization
  * PRESENT: 
    * Does Vitalik like or hate DeFi?
    * Vitalik's biggest concern for DeFi
    * Thoughts on liquidity mining
    * The goods & bads of speculation
    * Have we earned the price?
  * FUTURE: 
    * 3 problems we face now
    * Spartans vs Athenians - who wins?
    * Is Ethereum a nation, a religion, a technology?
    * How Etheruem is like Briton 
  * ETH THE ASSET 
    * Is ETH a triple point asset?
