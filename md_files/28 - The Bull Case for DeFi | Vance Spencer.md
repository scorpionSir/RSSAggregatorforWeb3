\----  
Vance Spencer of Framework was buying DeFi tokens when they were deeply
unpopular. Deep conviction on DeFi, but he and his co-founder made bets on
communities. He was contrarian yes...but contrarian right.  
  
Ask him his strategy and he'll simply tell you..."I look at memes all day."
But there's hidden brilliance in that phase. Listen as he describes how he
invests in the crypto native founders, how he buys culturally composable
communities, how the best things start very small.

His fund bought SNX when no on believed. They bought LINK when it was worth 18
cents. How? Why? What's he buying now?

We end with some FIRE predictions on final market caps for this bull run.

We cover:

  * Are we in a bull market?
  * The DeFi Bull Case
  * Crypto Native Investing Fund
  * Composable communities
  * Contrarian bets in the bear market
  * Where did the LINK marines come from?
  * Populism is real in crypto
  * REGULATORS are friends?
  * Turning Communities into Protocols
  * Farming Token Premium
  * Things Vance is buying
  * Price Predictions!!! ðŸ”¥
