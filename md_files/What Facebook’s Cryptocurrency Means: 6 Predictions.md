#  What Facebook’s Cryptocurrency Means: 6 Predictions

June 9, 2019 / [pwsadmin](https://caitlin-long.com/author/pwsadmin/) / [No

means-6-predictions/#respond)

What does Facebook’s new cryptocurrency mean? According to [news
reports](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/06/06/facebooks-
radical-bitcoin-beating-cryptocurrency-plans-revealed/#3cfad3a93564), Facebook
[will shortly launch Libra](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-
plans-outside-foundation-to-govern-cryptocurrency), a global cryptocurrency
available to users of its suite of platforms (including Messenger and
WhatsApp). Presumably any merchant with an account on these platforms could
transact in the cryptocurrency with customers who also have accounts—for
anything, such as online purchases, and physical-world purchases such as
groceries and restaurants. Facebook this week [revealed plans to announce
details on June 18](https://www.coindesk.com/facebooks-globalcoin-crypto-will-
be-tied-to-multiple-currencies-exec)and confirmed its cryptocurrency will be a
“[stablecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin)” whose value will be
tied to a basket of fiat currencies. Based on Facebook’s statement and several
anonymous comments made by people tied to the project in interviews with [The
Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-outside-
foundation-to-govern-cryptocurrency), I’ve made six predictions. To see them,
