Pilot Program**

August 19, 2020 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time

CHICAGO & NEW YORK--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--ErisX
today announced participation in a pilot program by the State of Hawaii’s
Digital Currency Innovation Lab (DCIL) to provide residents of Hawaii
immediate access to a U.S. based spot and regulated futures market on
cryptocurrencies. Under the two-year pilot program, ErisX is one of 12 digital
currency issuers allowed to do business in Hawaii without obtaining a state
money transmitter license.

> In partnership with the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions, the
> program is expected to create economic opportunities for Hawaii through
> early adoption of cryptocurrencies, offer consumer protection by providing
> guidance to issuers of cryptocurrencies and provide data to shape
> legislation supporting cryptocurrencies.

“We are proud to welcome ErisX into our pilot program and work with them to
position Hawaii at the forefront of financial technology innovation,” said Len
Higashi, acting executive director of the Hawaii Technology Development
Corporation (HTDC). “We look forward to ErisX contributing to the creation of
a secure, transparent and innovative crypto marketplace in the state.”

“We are pleased the HTDC recognizes our commitment to bring transparency and
security to the crypto markets. We welcome residents of the State of Hawaii to
the only U.S. based exchange to provide spot and regulated futures on
cryptocurrencies on one platform,” said Thomas Chippas, CEO of ErisX. “We
enable individual investors access to both cryptocurrencies and products to
manage their risk exposure.”

ErisX is an exchange and clearinghouse that includes a CFTC-regulated futures
market for Bitcoin and Ether as well as a 24/7 spot market for Bitcoin,
Bitcoin Cash, Ether and Litecoin. Eris Clearing, the in-house clearinghouse,
guarantees trades and eliminates counterparty risk.
