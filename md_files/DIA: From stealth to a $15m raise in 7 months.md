When we first met DIA, they were already an amazing team of 3 co-founders.
They joined our [Base Camp accelerator

and by December they had delivered results well beyond expectations. How did
Outlier Ventures help them achieve it?

DIA joined our [Base Camp accelerator
program](https://outlierventures.io/base-camp/) (open now) in September 2019.
By the end of the program in December he had already secured a solid SaaS
revenue stream pipeline, multiple advisors, public funding and already started
thinking about taking the product to the next level in the way we see it today
9 months later. How did he achieve it? Hear from himself below about the
challenges and how [Base Camp](https://outlierventures.io/base-camp/) helped:





When we first met DIA, they were already an amazing team of 3 co-founders.
They had their technical concepts nailed down and the product was well under
way although they were in stealth mode. What they struggled with was the scope
of the product, go to market approach in the middle of the 2019 bear market
and the best way to design and launch the network token. And this is where we
jumped in with our Base Camp investment during the peak of the bear market.

## Token Strategy

For their token strategy they needed a trusted partner with deep experience in
crypto and DLT. Our token economics team applied years of research into the
methodology of the 3D’s of Token Design by Outlier Ventures. Later our
marketing function helped DIA's team devise a strategy around the community.
DIA of course executed flawlessly. And our Head of Legal and Managing Partners
made sure everything was done properly. Nailing down regulations during a
raise is important as the SEC is now continuously cracking down on some of the
biggest sales of 2017.

## Go-to Market and Product

For product launch and market approach, we sat Michael down with mentors,
experts in financial technology, our partners and in-house research to
establish the best way to launch at first. This allowed him to build a solid
SaaS revenue stream from traditional financial institutions using the data
offering. This commercial traction allowed them to unlock investors and later
community support for their token distribution. We pledged to help founders
deliver tech and products that make sense in Web 3 and we're glad DIA was on
the same page as us.
