#  [FOSS Governance and Blockchain Networks](/blog/2020/7/14/foss-governance-

The principles of free and open source software (FOSS) are fundamental to the
ethos of the communities building blockchain networks. While it is not
uncommon for a single organization or small group of core developers to
coordinate and deliver most of the work, the source code is generally open for
everyone to inspect and improve upon. Control is maintained not by keeping
software proprietary, but through social and institutional means, including
ideological discourse, community management, and trademark license agreements.
Despite the unique governance challenges from issuing network-specific assets
to operators, investors, users, or other stakeholders, there are important
similarities between blockchain networks and traditional FOSS projects.
Existing research on FOSS governance may therefore prove helpful in designing
blockchain governance systems.
