# VPN vs Tor ‚Äî which is better?

# They‚Äôre meant to be the best options for protecting your online privacy, but
are they really?

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*l0mo7JBpgqhQjJ8_.png)

 **The internet was not built to be private and secure by default.**

Its flexible protocols allow people to build all kinds of software and
applications, but these all need to be protected against malware and **
**cybercriminals****.

In this ****[**VPN vs Tor vs dVPN**](https://mysterium.network/2020/04/15/tor-
or-vpn-whats-the-difference/) comparison (originally [published
here](https://mysterium.network/2020/04/15/tor-or-vpn-whats-the-difference/)),
we look at how these security tools are both similar and different.

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*GlkqhjFF5vKLV0EM67Hm2w.png)

 ** _Want to skip the read? Check out this video where we sum up the different
advantages of using VPN, Tor and dVPNs in a few minutes._**

# What is TOR ‚Äî is TOR a VPN?

Tor is a privacy project that launched in 2002. It‚Äôs an open-source and free
browser that **enables anonymous communication online**. It was first
developed by Syverson and computer scientists Roger Dingledine and Nick
Mathewson, who originally called it The Onion Router (Tor) project, due to its
**‚Äúlayers‚Äù of encryption.**

Tor browser and VPNs are similar in their aims but not in their technological
approach. While both will hide your identity and ensure your browsing activity
is kept private and encrypted, there are certain advantages and disadvantages
to each. That‚Äôs why using the two systems together is your safest bet for
securing your digital privacy.

# How Tor works

The Tor network utilises a system that was originally developed by the US Navy
to protect intelligence communications. It ‚Äúbundles‚Äù your data into smaller,
encrypted packets before it begins **routing these through its vast network of
nodes** , which can be run by anyone.

The chosen path is randomised and predetermined, and your traffic will pass
through a minimum of three relay nodes before it reaches a final exit node.

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*ieZyP9N_kY2f4A6W)

Each time your traffic passes through a relay node, a ‚Äúlayer‚Äù of encryption is
removed, revealing which relay node the traffic should be sent to next. Each
relay node will only be able to decrypt enough data to identify the location
of the next relay, and the one before it who passed on the traffic.

Exit nodes, however, remove the last layer of encryption. It can‚Äôt see your
location or IP address, but it is possible for an exit node to see your
activity if you visit an unsecure website (one that is not HTTPS).

# How does a VPN work?

A regular VPN seems much simpler, because there is a third party involved. You
can run an app in the background, or connect through a browser extension,
while you access sites around the world.

Your VPN provider will keep you hidden and encrypt all of your data,
**directing all your traffic to a remote server owned or hired by them.** You
can usually choose from a list of servers located across the world, so you‚Äôre
able to access the internet via a secure and private connection, and unblock
your content based on where a website is located. However, your protection has
its limits, and you won‚Äôt be completely anonymous.

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*5tYb16IZQfWCIjQr)

# What is a dVPN?

 **A decentralized VPN mimics the architecture of Tor more closely, but has
the same ease of use as a VPN.** As a peer to peer system, you plug into a
global network of nodes run by people voluntarily. However, **all nodes are
paid for providing the VPN service and keeping the network powered and safe.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*sTKjkq3udHfTqdFY)

One example of this in action is [Mysterium
Network](http://mysterium.network/) (the team which I work with). This dApp
(decentralized application) allows people to select the connection from a list
of available nodes (mostly providing residential IP addresses) from around the
world. Traffic is encrypted and directed through the network, and users pay
the provider for the minutes they are connected and the traffic they‚Äôre
sending through those nodes.

# Here‚Äôs a full breakdown of the fundamental differences of Tor vs VPN vs dVPN

 _For this comparison I use Mysterium as an example of a dVPN, though there
are other projects out there, each with their own technical approaches,
solutions and advantages._

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*5bbksm-vp7_ikaKYGGG9Yw.png)

# NETWORK DESIGN üß¨

 **dVPN:** A global collection of nodes (usually run in people homes) power a
VPN network by **sharing their bandwidth P2P in exchange for cryptocurrency.**
Users can easily become a node and also download the VPN app to select from a
global menu of node IDs.

 **Tor** : The main goal of Tor is privacy and anonymity. It‚Äôs a browser that
**anonymizes your web browsing** by sending your traffic through various nodes
in the Tor network, which can be hosted by anyone. Traffic cannot be traced as
each node encrypts it and hides the source IP.

 **VPN** : Not a network, but more a global centralised service that uses
**dedicated data center servers around the world** in hundreds of different
locations. Such VPN companies provide, centralized VPNs also allow P2P traffic
on certain servers and can additionally provide Dedicated IP address, Double
VPN, Onion Over VPN and connection to the Tor anonymity network.

# HOW ARE NODES REWARDED? üéÅ

 **dVPN:** P2P network allows nodes to set their own price based on **supply
and demand.** This unique micropayments system utilises cryptocurrency
payments, so nodes can **sell their bandwidth in small intervals** , ensuring
security and convenience.

 **Tor** : Tor doesn‚Äôt have incentivisation. All **nodes are operated by
volunteers.** This lack of incentivisation for nodes in the network has meant
it remains relatively small (after 10+ years of development, it still only has
6500 exit nodes).

 **VPN** : Nodes are not incentivized in centralized VPNs as these businesses
own the infrastructure and **charge end users for the service.**

# NODE ONBOARDING üß∞

 **dVPN: Anyone can run a node** using their laptop, or even mini computers
such as a Raspberry Pi. (In theory, even mobile devices can run one). Node
runners can link their crypto wallet address via an easy to use dashboard, and
track earnings.

 **Tor** : **Anyone can create and run a Tor node.** However, there are
[various technical
requirements](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide?ref=hackernoon.com#Partone:decidingtorunarelay)
and it‚Äôs recommended that you do not run a relay (non-exit) node from a
consumer-level route, as it may overwhelm it.

 **VPN** : VPN companies manage their own servers/exit nodes, so all setup and
maintenance is done by company‚Äôs employees. By paying for the service, users
get access to the VPN service, but do not help power it.

# COSTS & FEES üí∞

 **dVPN:** Users pay in cryptocurrency for only the bandwidth they consume on
a **pay-as-you-go mode** l. Nodes earn cryptocurrency directly from users of
this VPN service. They will pay a small fee to payment hubs for validation of
their payments, similar to paying miners for processing transactions in a
blockchain network.

 **Tor** : Free to use.

 **VPN** : Monthly subscription model, rather than a pay-as-you-go structure.
Sometimes users are even motivated to pay for a 3-year subscription in
advance.

# USER SECURITY üîê

 **dVPN:** As a fast and scalable security layer to reinvent privacy via VPN,
it‚Äôs built so that **different protocols can be plugged into the network.**

A traffic slicing solution could send traffic to different services via
different nodes. Thanks to Wireguard and OpenVPN protocols, it‚Äôs already
encrypted, so even ISPs can‚Äôt see what is in there.

 **Tor** : While Tor has better privacy properties, offers protection via
anonymity, it‚Äôs not risk free. Your **ISP can still see that you‚Äôre connected
to Tor.** This could lead to surveillance, as US government agencies (FBI/NSA)
are constantly trying to crack Tor and discover its users web activity.

The owner of the entry node will be able to see your real IP address. After
this node hides your address, the rest of the nodes will no longer know who
you are or what sites you visit. The last node will see what you‚Äôre looking
at, but not your identity. This presents some risks when using the network,
but in terms of fully private internet access, it is the **best available
option at the moment.**

 **VPN** : Traditional VPN services route all users‚Äô data through a remote
server, hiding IP addresses and encrypting all incoming and outgoing data. For
encryption, they use the OpenVPN and Internet Key Exchange v2/IPsec
technologies in their applications. One [company
admits](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/nordvpn-confirms-it-was-
hacked/?ref=hackernoon.com) their **servers were hacked** due to an expired
internal private key being exposed, potentially allowing anyone to spin out
their own servers imitating their own.

Additionally, **a VPN exit node knows a user‚Äôs IP** , destination addresses,
and in many cases (because of fiat payments) even user‚Äôs identity (name,
email, etc.). **** If that destination is not encrypted (e.g. not using
HTTPS), they can see the content you‚Äôre accessing, which may compromise your
security.

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*kbZ0y1ji9SEbfPoIW86Jpg.jpeg)

# LOGGING POLICY üìù

 **dVPN:** No centralized logs! The distributed architecture **removes any
technical possibility for collecting or storing logs centrally.**

 **Tor** : Some hypothesize that a number of nodes are run by malicious actors
(eg. the NSA) who could potentially control enough nodes to effectively track
users. The network itself is **unable to store logs** , however a Tor entry
and exit node may be able to see your activity or IP address, but actually
piecing the information together to identify you would require a lot of
effort.

 **VPN** : In theory, a centralized VPN *could* keep logs of a user‚Äôs
activity, but many state they are committed to a zero-logs policy. However,
nobody can be really sure that they‚Äôre not cooperating with governments or not
selling user‚Äôs browsing data to 3rd parties.

# EASE OF USE üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

 **dVPN** : Simple apps can be used on desktop or a mobile device.

New nodes can get set up in just 5 minutes and 5 steps via a simple, user-
friendly dashboard. There is a
[knowledgebase](https://help.mysterium.network/en/?ref=hackernoon.com) and
support team on hand to help. Users will need to have some **basic
understanding of cryptocurrency, and how to keep it secure.** An Ethereum
wallet is easy to set up, and you can receive payments any time.

 **Tor** : Anyone can download and install Tor browser to connect to the
internet (similar to any other browser).

However, browsing is quite slow (as all your traffic has to pass through
numerous nodes first). Its practical usability suffers (e.g. not being able to
unlock media content) but this drawback is the exchange for **better
anonymity.** For nodes, a Tor relay must be able to host a minimum of 100
GByte of outbound/inbound traffic per month.

 **VPN** : Many VPN services offer apps or browser extensions for instant
security. Some VPNs have features such as smart algorithms that can
automatically choose the best server for you based on location, time, or your
special requirements.

You can use a VPN because they‚Äôre easier to navigate, allow convenient payment
methods (eg. via credit card) and have 24/7 user support. However, they may
slow down your speed and don‚Äôt always have unlimited streaming options.

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*cgFxJ8-XXufG9hnJKZfc5A.png)

# SCALABILITY üöÄ

 **dVPN:** As with most P2P infrastructure, **** the more participants which
join the network, the **** stronger and more robust it becomes.

Mysterium‚Äôs micropayments system is a homegrown Layer 2 solution. It was built
to handle large volumes of users and transactions, **making the network fast
and more scalable.**

 **Tor** is currently used by a couple million of users. Due to its
distributed nature, the network can (in theory) grow larger. However it would
require a much higher number of nodes. Unfortunately, despite its millions of
users, Tor has not had huge growth in nodes due to its being a free service
run by volunteers. Without incentivisation for nodes, it can only grow so
fast.

 **VPN** : Depends on high bandwidth throughput and fast connection speeds to
provide an optimal service for their users. Often use multiple tunneling
protocols to ensure their network can scale and can adapt to various needs.

# COMPATIBLE WITH üì±üíª

 **dVPN** : Android, macOS, Windows, Linux.

 **Tor** : Tor for android, Windows, Mac, Linux and as a separate tab in Brave
browser.

 **VPN** : Offers the widest choice ‚Äî Android, Windows, Mac, iOS,
Chrome/Firefox extension, Linux.

# OPEN SOURCE? üìñ

 **dVPN** : Yes ‚Äî transparent and collaborative from Ground Zero. Check out
Myst [codebase](https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork?ref=hackernoon.com).

 **Tor** : Yes ‚Äî open source pioneer ‚Äî check out Tor
[codebase](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/?ref=hackernoon.com).

 **VPN** : No ‚Äî centralized VPNs are proprietary and closed source. You can
only imagine what they do with your collected data stored in their servers.

# DECENTRALIZED? üåê

 **dVPN** : Duh.

 **Tor** : Yes, but it doesn‚Äôt use blockchain for payments.

 **VPN** : Nope.

# NETWORK STATUS üìä

 **dVPN:** Testnet live, ~900 residential nodes, with more than 600 live at
any given point.

 **Tor** : Approx. 6500 exit nodes.

 **VPN** : Depends on the size of your provider, but the largest will connect
you to a VPN server in over 59 countries.

# So, Tor or VPN ‚Äî why not both?

Tor and VPNs/dVPNs are complementary solutions, so they can work together to
enhance your privacy and security even more.

There are two methods for merging Tor with VPN:

 **VPN on Tor:** connect to the Tor browser, then use a VPN. This is a more
complex method as it requires some manual configuration. As your VPN server
acts as the final exit node, Tor‚Äôs own exit nodes will not be able to peel
back the final layer of encryption to reveal your activity. While your ISP can
tell that you‚Äôre using Tor, it wouldn‚Äôt be able to trace you and keeps your IP
address hidden from your VPN service.

 **Tor over VPN** : Connect to your VPN, then use Tor browser. Your VPN will
encrypt your traffic before it enters the Tor network, and also hides your IP
address. It also hides the fact you‚Äôre using Tor from your ISP. However, if
your VPN provider chooses to keep logs, it can see that you‚Äôre using Tor. This
is why it‚Äôs best that you use a decentralised VPN, which cannot keep user
logs.

Both [Mysterium](https://mysterium.network/?ref=hackernoon.com) and
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/?ref=hackernoon.com) can be pieced together
to ensure full privacy coverage and secure internet access. One of Mysterium‚Äôs
most considered features is to extend our whitelisting in such a way so that
your traffic would only exit via a Mysterium node‚Äôs IP, while the rest would
be forwarded throughout the Tor network. In this way, **Mysterium users will
get to unblock content, and our node runners will not risk unwanted content
passing through.**

![](https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*cK4jhKZQJGaD3eFQz98Zwg.jpeg)

# The Bigger Picture

Decentralized privacy networks like Mysterium and Tor are **grassroots, open
source technologies** who have managed to grow large **community-driven**
platforms without any corporate backing or support.

However, we have one point of difference; **while regular VPNs offer to
protect their users (for a price), we believe the fight against surveillance
and censorship is a shared one.**

>  _Regular VPNs do nothing to address the infrastructural flaws of the
> internet, instead they apply a quick fix solution. We want to rebuild the
> internet itself, creating people-powered networks that are immune to
> corporate or government control._

In the case of Mysterium, a trustless and P2P [micropayment
system](https://mysterium.network/2019/11/04/introducing-mysterium-payment-
system/?ref=hackernoon.com) (currently on testnet) can become a game-changer
and will lead to a much higher amount of exit nodes.

Tor helped kickstart this **grassroots anonymity revolution** and now the dVPN
industry is taking it even further.
