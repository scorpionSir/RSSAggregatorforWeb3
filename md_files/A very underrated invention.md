###  A very underrated invention

Perhaps the most underrated invention in history is the humble hourglass.
Invented in Europe during the late 13th or early 14th century, the sand glass
complemented a nearly simultaneous invention, the mechanical clock.  The
mechanical clock with its bell was a centralized way of broadcasting the hours
day and night; the sand glass was a portable way of measuring shorter periods
of time.  These clocks were made using very different and independent
techniques, but their complementarity function led to their emergence at the
same time and place in history, late medieval Europe.  
  
The sandglass was more portable than a water clock. Since its rate of flow is
independent of the depth of the upper reservoir, it was also more accurate.
And, important in northern Europe, it didn't freeze in winter.

From the point of view of later engineers, the mechanical clock was the more
important invention -- they were on the cutting edge of technology from the
time of their invention until the industrial revolution.  However,  

> For contemporaries....the sandglass was equally or more important.   Until

> couldn't be fudged like a mechanical clock.

As I detail [here](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2012/10/dead-reckoning-
and-exploration-explosion.html),  the sand glass also played an essential role
in the technique of dead reckoning for ocean navigation, also developed in
late medieval Europe.  A strict regimen of turning the glasses was kept non-
stop throughout a voyage:  

> During the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan around the globe, his vessels kept
> 18 hourglasses per ship. It was the job of a ship's page to turn the
> hourglasses and thus provide the times for the ship's log. Noon was the
> reference time for navigation, which did not depend on the glass, as the sun
> would be at its zenith.[8] More than one hourglass was sometimes fixed in a
> frame, each with a different running time, for example 1 hour, 45 minutes,
> 30 minutes, and 15 minutes. [[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass)]

Arab and Chinese navigators lacked this crucial piece, and thus by the time of
the exploration explosion had not developed navigation techniques that could
rival those of Western Europe.

"Like most blogs worth my attention, this blog is updated only infrequently.
That is because the authors of blogs worth my attention only post when they
have something to say that is true, relevant and not already known by their
audience. Most of the human race does not have the skill to know when an idea
has these three properties. The skill is particularly rare in the fields of
politics and economics, which is why this blog is such a rare and valuable
thing." \-- [Richard Hollerith](http://dl4.jottit.com/)
