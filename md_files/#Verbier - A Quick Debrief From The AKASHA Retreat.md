## #Verbier - A Quick Debrief From The AKASHA Retreat

By [AKASHA Team](/blog/author/akasha-team/)

¬∑

July 31, 2019

From July 15-20th, the majority of the AKASHA team met in Switzerland for an
epic retreat to discuss next steps, and to plan the AKASHA Reloaded rollout
strategy. üöÄ

Unfortunately, we couldn't be joined by Andrey, Josh, or Mariana, and so we
made sure that we took plenty of photos, and toasted to their good health as
often as possible. üçª

The plans made on the Retreat will carry us from now until the end of the
year... so it was kind of a big deal! üòÖ

As a distributed team, it's quite a rare thing for even a few of us to find
ourselves in the same location. To mark this momentous occasion, we thought
we'd give you a quick anatomy of the AKASHA Retreat, complementing this with a
cross-section of team members‚Äô views, in order to give you a flavor of what
the AKASHA Team will be up to in the coming months. Our thorough and exciting
schedule had been rigorously put together by Retreat-organizer extraordinare,
Roxana, and so we were all brimming with excitement at what the following days
were going to bring. ü§©

The journey started off with a fascinating 3.5-hour bus journey discussing the
value of [#LibreNotLibra](https://librenotlibra.info/) and the general concern
around Project Libra as a "blockchain" initiative. Driving a large coach up
the mountains towards Verbier brought some hilarious reactions from the group,
with some laughing, and others preferring to close their eyes and hope for the
best (not looking at you, [Anderson, our resident
skydiver](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/07/04/team-anderson-quadros/).) ‚úàÔ∏è

**Get to Know Each Other Monday** üí•ü§ùüí•

admiring the view on a much-needed coach break_

Arriving at the amazing location, No. 14, we were greeted by the wonderful
house staff, Chris and Lauren. Soon after we were standing on the veranda with
a drink and launching a drone into the air to capture some great footage of
the team. A quick dip in the hot tub and then we then got into the nitty
gritty of getting to know each other - three challenging questions were on the
agenda for each of us:

**1) If you could do something that you were guaranteed not to fail at, what
would it be?** ü§î

**2) If you could choose to either have the ability to speak to animals or be
able to speak multiple languages, which would you choose?** üêá

**3) If you could extend your day by an extra hour to do something you really
wanted to do, what would it be?** ‚åõ

_‚ÄúTaking a pragmatic approach as always - my answers were as follows:_

_1) Sing - being Irish it is always assumed that I can sing - I can 't - I
sound like a foghorn._

_2) Languages - never something I 've mastered so that would be a treat!_

_3) Reading - since technology has taken over and instant gratification is
required by reading articles and Twitter, I miss good, old-fashioned books._

_Once done, we retreated (see what I did there) to the dining room for a
wonderful dinner and continuation of our discussions from the questions
raised. After dinner the evening continued to the pool where we plunged
further into conversation for the rest of the night. Objective achieved - we
got to know each other and had a wonderful time in the process.‚Äù_ ‚Äî _Kevin_

**Reloaded Tuesday** üë©‚ÄçüöÄüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ

presenting on Tuesday_

On Tuesday we took to the whiteboards and laptops to present and ask questions
about AKASHA Reloaded. This session involved defining objectives, working out
our core value proposition, and discussing why exactly we are undertaking this
work.

made the space into a home away from home_

These kinds of conversations usually take place in front of a screen, with
headphones in, and so the team relished in the novelty of being able to be
physically near to the individuals that they are working with; [as discussed
in a previous article](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/06/25/how-we-work), there
are some amazing benefits to being part of a remote-first team, but once in a
while it is of great benefit to interact without having to talk through the
medium of technology (aside from digital presentation tools and a whacking-
great TV). üì∫

_‚ÄúTuesday marked the first official working day of the retreat. In the morning
we had a really nice intro session from Mihai and Roxana. In the afternoon I
presented and hosted a discussion in which I highlighted the pros and cons of
DIDs.‚Äù_ \- Andrei

the tough and important questions_

On Wednesday, the Dev Team took over to talk about the current status of the
different products that they are working on, before we moved on to a session
all about segmenting and looking at the needs of different users. The day also
contained a talk about how we organize ourselves, and the tools that we use.
üß∞‚öíÔ∏è

_‚ÄúWe had the dev team presentation, introducing the rest of the team to the
architecture of what we are trying to build, arriving at a common
understanding of the naming conventions and functionality ... then starting
from ‚Äòwhy are we doing this?‚Äô we arrived at the necessity to build while
keeping early adopters in mind, for this, we started to develop personas (user
profiles), focusing on a number of questions on how they would relate to our
product‚Äù_ \- Vali

After all those pens and whiteboards, it was time for something a bit more
scenic. We took e-bikes out for a spin and spent six hours exploring the area.

_" We had a really fun e-biking day in Verbier, going up and enjoy the amazing
views of the Dents, Grand Combin, and Mont Blanc massif" \- Roxana_

The sights and sounds of Verbier are particularly popular, as it hosts the
world's largest e-bike festival! Once we were up high enough, we got the drone
up again to get a fantastic, scenic shot. üì∑

elation you can only find at the top of a mountain_

_" We passed through forests, green fields, tunnels and small streams,
involved in that vibrant Swiss summer mood. Fresh air, nature and silence.
Drowned in peacefulness. We admired the landscape from above. We then went
downhill. Only some of us left the brakes for more than a second (once more
you can tell we are not used to being AFK)._

_We had lunch in a small mountain restaurant and then back to town. Tired but
still finding some energy for walking home and keep working on use-case
personas for a couple of hours till we could finally_ ü•Ç _cheers_ üçª _to a good-
enough solution. We then surrendered to dinner and to a well-deserved pool
bath "_ ‚Äî Lorenzo

**Community Friday** ‚ú®üë•‚ú®

about AKASHA‚Äôs appeal to the Social Do-ers of the world_

We took Friday to try and understand our community a bit better, reinforcing
the idea that we need to look deeper to find the motivations and wants of the
people that we are working towards supporting. This included a conversation
about how Hubs fit into our overall strategy, and, in the spirit of community,
a wonderful final evening of drinks and dinner. ü•Çüçú

_‚ÄúFriday was a day for trying on others‚Äô shoes. We need to understand people
who aren‚Äôt exactly like us but who will be attracted to our purpose and
therefore our work. We need to reflect on what might constitute their
worldview, and identify ways in which we can nurture relationships so we can
find out for sure first hand.‚Äù - Philip_

_" The Barcelona and Dublin hubs discussed their values and value proposition,
and presented what they have been working on, local initiatives, examples of
contributions made by members of the community, and their vision for the
future._

_Then we gathered to celebrate an amazing week spent together in an amazing
dinner - followed by lots of fun with the jacuzzi, pool, and video games. "_
\- _Anderson_

## **The Takeaways** üí≠üí°

Team takeaways ranged from understanding each others‚Äô work better, to gaining
a greater sense of what it is we are creating, and how to talk about it.

**Here are a select few quotes:**

_‚Äú[We now have] a more focused way of communicating the initiatives of the
foundation, both externally and internally‚Äù_

_‚ÄúI really felt to get for the first time a holistic view of our activities
and it felt great to discuss details‚Äù_

_‚ÄúFor me, the biggest takeaway was that I feel we 've started to work well as
a team, and we know better the goals ahead of us both in terms of development
and strategy‚Äù_

_‚ÄúEveryone understands what are we trying to build and have a clearer idea of
terminology ‚Ä¶_ _Everyone knows what are our priorities and what should we
focus on‚Äù_

_" We all strongly agreed that, current scenario, in particular ref. Libra,
alternatives are needed, and we all engaged in building them"_

To round this off, we were all asked to sum up AKASHA Reloaded in one word,
answers included:

_Potent, Progress, Potential, Connecting, Cohesion, Coordinated,
Foundational,_ and _Revolutions_

**The future looks bright, and more well defined‚Ä¶** üöÄüôåüöÄ

team together at last!_

The AKASHA Retreat is the most-awaited event in our yearly calendar, and what
a Retreat it was; as always we are indebted to our top-tier Retreat-organizer,
Roxana for a whole host of exciting and valuable bonding experiences! üéâüá®üá≠

We've returned to our homes and places of work with a renewed sense of clarity
and purpose, ready to create something beautiful together. Keep your eyes on
