The Ownership Economy | Jesse Walden

Jesse Walden speaks about 'the ownership economy', in which value is returned
to the producers via a protocol by compensation codified in its core.

YouTube, Facebook, Twitter are now extracting more than they are providing.

Can Ethereum and DeFi solve this? How can Ethereum host an internet-sized
cooperative, like REI? How can token ownership create a larger tent, that can
scale organizations past previous limits?

We also discuss Jesse's 3 theories for how crypto will be adopted, and which
one he believes will come first:

\- The people come, Bank the Unbanked!  
\- The institutions come, WallStreet wants part of the global casino \- The
economy comes, non-financial apps create a ‚Äúreal economy"
