> ####  **Election Betting Roundup**

Nate Silver, political pundit behind the data-centric blog, 538, has a history
of dragging prediction markets for their forecasting aptitude relative to his:

Silver @NateSilver538@BrendanNyhan @DavMicRot We think we have a massive edge
though in constructing topline odds and probability distributions when it
comes to the complex stuff—overall odds on the Electoral College, the House
the Senate and various parlays therein. We've consistently kicked PredictIt's
ass on those.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1060183217540612096)

Silver @NateSilver538@HarryDCrane @JustinWolfers There have been many betting
market vs 538 studies, and their conclusions are inconclusive. Sometimes 538
is little better, sometimes the markets are. That's a TERRIBLE result for
prediction markets. It means they add no marginal value relative to 538, which
is public and

Well, a number of people are taking exception to these, erm, playful barbs?
Most notably, [Flip Pidot](https://twitter.com/FlipPidot), formerly of
PredictIt, and Rutgers professor, [Harry
Crane](https://twitter.com/HarryDCrane), took to recording an episode of
Flip’s show, [Old Bull
TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOabUJ3mn2NftdU16AIeHiQ/videos) to
discuss models vs. markets. Crane emphasizes that skin in the game and a
number of other factors tip the forecasting supremacy to markets ( **Bonus** :
[See a sneak preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxV2FAHw4sA) of the next
episode of Old Bull TV featuring Augur co-founder, Joey Krug).

The upcoming state contests will be interesting to watch in the context of
models vs. markets. As Sophie Hill notes below, there is a strong divergence
between 538 and PredictIt on Bernie and Biden’s relative chances in Iowa.

Further, you can see below each candidate’s respective chances at winning
Iowa, as appraised by 538’s model versus their corresponding PredictIt prices:

#### Predicting Iowa  

As we approach the first state contest, the Iowa Caucus, it’s as good of a
time as any to get opinions on the Democratic Nomination field from one of the
more public-facing political traders.  

    
    
     _“Iowa is about momentum, Iowa is about surpassing expectations and Iowa is about failing to meet expectations.  Iowa is about the media narrative.  The delegates won from Iowa are unlikely to matter in the end and are not a substantial number in any event.” **Jason Pipkin**_

  
[Jason Pipkin](https://twitter.com/jipkin) knows his stuff. You can see his
**[trade
diary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-yrcSICX9uH5CqEUMBk5nM4PClTwCUIbctlux32zmDg/edit#gid=0)**
for the DemNom market featuring over 10k trades and $7,100 in profit. On
Jason’s blog, **[Predicting Politics](https://predictingpolitics.com/)** , he
details the case for each candidate to take Iowa:

  *  **`Bernie:`** _“Bernie wins Iowa when Liz continues to fall and caucusgoers attending precincts where she isn’t viable and can’t become viable mainly go to him.”  
_

  *  **`Biden:`** _“Joe Biden wins Iowa because polls like Suffolk are right, because  [older voters who support him but didn’t say they would caucus ](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1221804109449306119)end up turning out anyway, because Liz stays strong enough to keep Bernie from running away with all her delegates…”  
_

  *  **`Pete:`** _“Pete Buttigieg doesn’t win Iowa.”  
_

  *  **`Warren:`** _“Warren wins Iowa because she has a great ground game, the NYT and DMR endorsements matter (lol) and because Bernie softens in the final week of polling.”  
_

In an **[earlier post](https://predictingpolitics.com/2019/12/14/gaming-out-
iowa/)** on Predicting Politics, Jason details the game theory behind trading
each candidate post-Iowa depending on the results:  

>  _ **A Clear Winner, A Striking-Distance Second, Distant Third and Fourth**_
>
>  _Candidate A – 40%_
>
>  _Candidate B – 30%_
>
>  _Candidates C,D – 9-15%_
>
>  _Betting action:_
>
>  _If Candidate A is Bernie – max Bernie in NH, obviously, and take him out
> for a spin in NV and SC (but if B is Joe, don’t hold those SCs).   B here is
> either Pete or Joe – if it’s Pete honestly I’d probably just max Bernie
> everywhere and call it.  If it’s Joe, then Pete is done and Liz has the
> barest of chances remaining.  Regardless, you’re max betting against C and D
> here almost no matter what._

Bonus:** Pipkin on the [Star Spangled Gamblers
podcast](https://starspangledgamblers.com/2020/01/29/podcast-jason-pipkin-
joins-to-talk-about-the-early-state-primaries/) discussing early primary
states.
