Andre Cronje calls himself just another DeFi dev, but you can't help but
wonder, is he's underselling himself with that title?

In a few short months he single-handedly created a fleet of DeFi yield farming
money robots that locked up over $400m in assets in his yearn protocol. He
launched a YFI token that grew in value by over 1,000% in its first week, one
of the most explosive price charts crypto has ever seen.

No pre-mine, no VC, no founders reward.

Maybe a better title is King of the Yield Farmers.

DeFi's Satoshi.  

Who is this guy?

What did he build and why is it brilliant?

Why did YFI go from $3 on July 17th to $5000 on August 8th?

This is everything you need to know about yearn, YFI, and Andre.

We cover:

  * How Andre's really feeling
  * What's up with "I test in prod"
  * Why high YFI price can be bad
  * How Yearn automates yield farming
  * Andre's money robots
  * Incenting strategy writers
  * Risks of yearn
  * Launching YFI to scale
  * Why people buy YFI
  * Organic governance
  * Is Andre The Joker?
  * What's coming next

Join us next Monday for a fresh episode!
