## Slingshot Week One Recap

It’s been an exciting week with the kickoff of Filecoin Slingshot, a two-part
competition for storage clients and developers to deploy their products to the
testnet. Phase One of this competition (“Onboard”), which started on September
23, 2020 and runs through October 14, aims to onboard 1PiB of real, useful
data to the Filecoin network. Phase Two (“Scale”) aims to onboard 10PiB of
data. Between the two phases, participants have a chance at getting a share of
a prize pool of up to 500,000 FIL based on their network storage commitments!

Slingshot is part of Filecoin’s [Ignite series](https://ignite.fil.events/) of
events, and is a collaborative event intended to stress-test the network and
encourage participation from storage users all over the world. Space Race 2:
Slingshot is designed specifically for storage clients, app developers,
tooling providers, and other community members. Teams can participate in the
competition in one of two ways:

  1. Build an end-user facing application that stores application and user data to Filecoin.
  2. Store data from a [curated list of data collections](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md) and create an accompanying UI to utilize and access this data.

To date, we’ve had more than 100 teams sign up for the competition, making
more than 26,000 storage deals so far. Slingshot is accepting applications
through the end of the competition! You can register to participate
[here](https://slingshot.filecoin.io/register-now).

Here’s where the competition stands as of 20:00 UTC Friday, September 25, two
days into the competition:

**Week One in Review**

On September 23rd, we launched the competition with our [kickoff
event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTn2QCLh1PY). During this event, the
Slingshot team introduced the rules, announced upcoming events and shared
guidance for participants entering the competition. In addition, Andrew Hill,
co-founder and CEO of [Textile](https://textile.io/), advised teams on how to
accelerate their products with Textile’s tools, and Juan Benet, founder and
CEO of Protocol Labs, offered ideas for different datasets and applications.

On September 25, we held our first Slingshot Master Class, [Filecoin
101](https://youtu.be/qKUHKFzYws8), where @ribasushi, a developer at Protocol
Labs, covered the basics of Filecoin in a hands-on tutorial. Topics included
the concepts underpinning Filecoin, using the CLI, and making deals with
miners.

**What’s Ahead**

We have more amazing events coming up, including more master classes, open
office hours, workshops, and a series called “How We Built This” that
showcases development teams and how they built their projects and/or
companies. You can always find the latest events schedule
[here](https://slingshot.filecoin.io/events).
