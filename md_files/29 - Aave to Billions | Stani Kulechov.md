Stani Kulechov is the Founder of the Aave money market, a place for lending
and borrowing assets in DeFi.

Aave has marched up the DeFi leaderboard to become one of the top protocols
with the most amount of value deposited into its contracts. Aave's token LEND
has increased 3300% since its bear market low.

What contributed to Aave's success? What did Aave do differently? Why did
Aave's community thrive when others died? What's next for Aave and Aavenomics?

We ask Stani these questions and many more, in order to get a glimpse of what
is successful in this DeFi frontier!

1) Crypto-Native Founders  
2) Early days of Aave -- ETHLend and the Aave pivot  
3) Sticking it out through the bear market  
4) Establishing the team-community relationship  
5) Rising the Ranks of DeFi  
6) VC investment vs ICO investment; pros and cons
