## Want to Learn More about Filecoin? Start here.

Just in time for back to school, we’re here to get you up to speed on all
things Filecoin. The following “syllabus” of instructional videos and
materials covers all aspects of the Filecoin network – from mining to storage
to application development. This resource is designed for anyone interested in
learning about the history and development of the network, as well as how to
leverage the network at all levels: mining, building, and storing.

network**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dkzLJuv1jc&list=PLXzKMXK2aHh43-aCLLuGnny7nhnsf49LO&index=14&t=0s)

Lotus, the reference implementation of the Filecoin protocol, is your path to
connecting to the Filecoin network and interacting with your peers! In this
interactive workshop, we’ll go over the architecture of Lotus, walk through
installing Lotus and syncing the blockchain, and examine how you can explore
Filecoin’s functionality through the Lotus node.

**Length:**1 hour
