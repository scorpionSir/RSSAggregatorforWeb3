An interview with me on the Bitcoin block size limit appeared on 4 May 2016 on
_Bitcoin.com_. Below, I develop additional clarifications and examples partly
inspired by a range of comments and reactions to it. This is meant to build on
and develop ideas in [the original interview](https://news.bitcoin.com/konrad-
graf-bitcoin-block-size-economy/). For ease of reference, here is a [PDF
version](https://www.konradsgraf.com/s/Block-size-interview-4-May-2016.pdf) of
that interview.

This is a three-part series. Part 1 below covers a range of issues including
the need to differentiate the market that was discussed in the interview from
other distinct markets and non-market choice phenomena such as free software
selection. It also begins to discuss the use of the term market intervention
in this context. Part 2 will then continue by arguing that neither the
voluntary nature of cryptocurrency participation nor the subjective nature of
user preferences nor any alleged motivations on the part of the various actors
involved alters my analysis. Finally, Part 3 will focus on economic
distinctions between the 21-million bitcoin production schedule and the block
size limit, arguing that these are different in kind and thus poor objects for
analogy.

**Two markets and a non-market choice sphere**

One idea that showed up in comments was that I had expressed some view as to
which Bitcoin software one ought to run. However, I did not address this at
all. I have only published one previous [preliminary
article](http://www.konradsgraf.com/blog1/2015/6/20/preview-the-market-for-
bitcoin-transaction-inclusion-and-the.html) on the block size limit, on 20
June 2015, and this also did not mention implementation choice. Various views
on this topic do not alter my analysis of the topics that I did address.

A related idea is that the current dominant software implementation already
reflects “the choice of the market.” Therefore, any discussion of differences
between a cryptocurrency having or not having a given block size limit is
moot: the “market” has already spoken and this is evident in implementation
share statistics.

It should be cautioned, however, that software choice reflects many
considerations. Interpreting it as a proxy for a single issue is imprecise.
Such choices may well reflect a generalized confidence in perceived quality
and reliability. A user could therefore make a particular software choice
either: 1) _because_ of one specific code issue, 2) _despite_ that same
particular issue, or 3) _regardless_ of it.

Such imprecision and ambiguity are among the reasons I did not discuss this
matter at all. A more fundamental reason, however, is that it has no bearing
on my analysis. Whether some percentage of a given population prefers Pepsi or
Earl Grey tea does not alter the composition of the respective beverages in
the slightest way, nor their respective effects on metabolism. Such things can
be studied and assessed independently of the current statistical shape of user
preferences.

In addition, choice of which free software to run does not really constitute a
market, except in a metaphorical sense. Developers offer software products and
users select and run such products. In a free software context, nothing is
bought or sold between these groups. No price signals exist directly between
users and developers.

In contrast, the central topic I addressed—the market for the inclusion of
transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain—is indeed a market, one that involves
quite different roles and actions than producing or running one version or
another of free software. This is __ a market in which bidders send
transactions, which takers (miners) either include or not in each respective
candidate block. This market involves specific senders of specific
transactions (not senders in general of transactions in general). At the other
end, specific miners build each of their respective candidate blocks. In
deciding whether to include any, all, or some transactions, fee/byte (bid) is
salient. Node operators act as key intermediaries, like referring brokers,
currently uncompensated. On-chain and off-chain transacting options, both
existing and potential, coexist in this context in a complex blend of
competition and synergy.

There are therefore at least several phenomena to differentiate. First, the
buying and selling of bitcoin forms textbook markets on the order of
commodities and forex markets. Those effectively controlling given bitcoin
units can sell such control in exchange for some other money unit, product, or
service, or give them away as gifts. Second, bidding for on-chain transaction
inclusion and miner decisions to include or not include transactions in
candidate blocks forms a distinct open-bid market for on-chain inclusion
priority. Third, developers offering free software and users making decisions
on which implementations to run for their various purposes does not constitute
a market in the sense of a complex of buying and selling behavior.

Whatever one may choose to _call_ these three phenomena, each is meaningfully
distinct from the other, describing different sets of actions and roles. To
claim that “the market has spoken” in the context of software choice is
therefore far less informative that it might at first appear to be. Making
such a claim requires specifying what exactly has allegedly spoken (it isn’t a
market) and the content of this purportedly speaking thing’s alleged message
(ambiguously mixed with considerations such as general perception of code
reliability).

 **The term “market intervention”**

Several commenters took issue with my use of the term market intervention in
this context. It is true that market intervention has a negative connotation
for many readers, though not all. Indeed, a great many persons eagerly
advocate some form of governmental intervention in economic affairs as part of
their ordinary political opinions. Still, one interpretation would be that I
had set out to create negative connotations and thus arrived at my word choice
using rhetorical criteria.

A different interpretation would be that I set out to select the most accurate
available technical term to describe the phenomenon under consideration. I
then specified what I meant in using this term _and_ excluded certain
inapplicable historical and institutional associations. This is my own first-
hand interpretation of what I did in selecting this language. That it _still_
has negative connotations for some may be natural in that what it describes
has negative effects. However, word choice one way or another does not alter
such effects.

Another related but more substantive criticism that appeared in several
variants argues that a block size limit is just a qualitative characteristic
of a cryptocurrency as a good. A given limit is baked into what the good is.
As such, it cannot be construed using the model of economic intervention. If a
characteristic is already _in_ the product, how could it possibly be construed
as intervention (from outside)?

However, I had already stressed in the interview how novel and unprecedented
this situation is. My argument was that _even though_ the legal and practical
contexts of traditional interventionism conducted by state agencies are
completely different, _nevertheless_ , the economic effects are on this
transaction-inclusion market as a government enforced industrywide output
ceiling _would be_. This will be addressed further in Part 2.

A commenter suggested that I was arguing from history that the current block
size limit was not part of “consensus.” Consensus, in this debate, often seems
to transcend a mere computer science fact to also encompass an allusion to a
hard Bitcoin _Realpolitik_. Any other considerations, such as the documented
history of the block size limit, are irrelevant to this current reality.

However, I did not reference or use any concept of consensus at all. Nor did I
question the reality of any given state of consensus on the network at any
given time. What I did was analyze differences between possible states of code
and then describe economic and social implications of such differences.

A loosely related idea was that my analysis was tantamount to advocating that
cryptocurrencies should not maintain any limits or standards. If calling into
question one sort of limit, such as the current Bitcoin block size limit, why
not just question all limits? Why not just also advocate raising the maximum
coin count? That, after all, is also a “limit,” so why not call keeping that
in place an “intervention” too? This will be addressed in greater detail in
Part 3.

The interview itself concerned one such limit and not any others. Why? I could
have branched off to discuss the sociology of decision-making or described a
software preference. But I did no such things. I could have discussed any
other protocol characteristic or issue. Why did I discuss only this one? The
answer is that I think _this_ limit has unique economic __ features that are
both important and poorly understood. Explaining this was therefore the focus.
