From AngelList’s study we’ve learned that the best returns are made by
investing “[in every credible early stage deal](https://angel.co/blog/venture-
returns)” - think a “startup index/ETF”.

Consider a quote by Peter Thiel:

>  _“When you have too many people thinking substantively about shorting the
> market, the procedural shortcut is to buy an index fund. If everyone does
> process it wont work. We are in a world where things are geared towards
> process and away from substance.”  _

AngelList’s conclusion is that “you’d be better off blindly investing in every
credible deal” which they have translated to “invest in a startup index”. I
find this to be an error of confusing “ _what the market says about an
aggregate_ ” with “ _this is what you as an individual ought to do_ ”.

The aggregate result of the market is not a product of a uniform individual
action. It’s a product of many very different actions. Reverse-engineering the
process from the perspective of the aggregate will not get you the best course
of action for an individual.

This is comparable to a notion of “[scale transformation (e.g. morality does
not scale)](https://www.academia.edu/38433249/Principia_Politica)”:

>  _The intentions and morality of individual agents does not aggregate to
> groups. And the reverse: attributes of groups do not map to those of
> agents._
>
>  _The standard mechanism is well grasped: competition makes prices adequate
> by pushing them towards the margin; price formation has nothing to do with
> the individual intentions of agents. But it is the second step, the wedge
> between intentions and outcomes, and, more generally, scale transformation,
> that is not generalized._

In other words; what one ought to do according to an ex post reading of the
aggregate does not map to what an individual should do to succeed (ex ante
action). Can I go as far as comparing it to “[lecturing birds on how to
fly](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/750488970425954304?s=20)”?

Let’s think about the index of startup from an [evolutionary game theory
perspective](https://www.bitcast.fm/DAP982). (Same goes for passive investing
in general)

Say that at some point, the most energy/efficient strategy for a seal is not
to go catch a fish but wait for other seals to return with fish and then steal
it from them. Now a Seal Journal publishes these numbers, seals read it and
realize that their effort to actually go find fish is suboptimal.

Seals switch the strategy to maximize their gains under the equilibrium
described by the Seal Journal. This strategy has zero-sum implications for the
given seal community and can only last if enough seals are actually making an
effort of catching fish. Now the equilibrium has changed. Not enough seals are
catching fish.

I do not mean to belittle the significance of statistics but I do think it’s
dangerous to think about the world in terms of [probabilities
](https://blakemasters.com/post/23435743973/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-
class-13-notes)_[only](https://blakemasters.com/post/23435743973/peter-thiels-
cs183-startup-class-13-notes)_. Such thinking leads to people not targeting
specific options that will unfold. They just figure that they will have plenty
of options and it does not matter which options they pick as long as they pick
enough of them.

We cannot calculate what the future will look like. The future depends on
people trying (and failing) to calculate it. The
[antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) of the system
depends on its fragile units. If everyone will just buy an antifragile index
of startups and no one will be picking these units (startups) within the
index, the whole system collapses.

> class-13-notes)_

Keynesians say that in the long-run we’ll all be dead. Let’s only care about
the short-run. How long will it take before [ a long-run becomes a short-
run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3byZ5WfTzA)? This is similar to saying
that there’s no way to know the future so do attempt to create it. How long
before there will be no future if there are no people trying to create it?

Talking about the indices of startups is dangerous. The way I read the results
of AngelList study is that [great technologies come from tinkering, not
“reason.” That is why technological success is only trivial
retrospectively—not prospectively](https://www.bitcast.fm/DCU515).

People making _bad_ decisions individually leads to greater than good
outcomes. Playing it safe by buying an index and “investing blindly” prevents
people from actually having ideas about the future. (Also, under the new
equilibrium the _then-good decision_ may lead to terrible outcomes.)

Reducing our worldview to math might distort the world in a very bad way:
_E.g. making all LPs invest in an index of every credible deal without actual
VCs selecting them and entrepreneurs merely optimizing for their ideas to look
“credible”.  _

I’ll conclude with recommendation of Yudkowsky’s [Inadequate
Equilibria](https://equilibriabook.com/):

>  _There’s no real alternative to sticking your neck out, even knowing that
> reality might surprise you and chop off your head...Run experiments; place
> bets; say oops. Anything less is an act of self-sabotage._
