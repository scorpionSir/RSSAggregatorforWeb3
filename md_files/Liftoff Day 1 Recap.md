## Liftoff Day 1 Recap

Yesterday we wrapped up Day 1 at Filecoin Liftoff Week. We heard from Filecoin
founder, Juan Benet, Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, Stanford
Professor Dan Boneh, outside general counsel Marta Belcher, and more. Here are
some highlights from the day, as well as a snapshot of what’s in store for Day
2.

### 🦸‍♂️The Internet has given us superpowers

In his opening keynote, Founder and CEO of Protocol Labs Juan Benet asked
everyone to first take a step back and think about what our lives are like
now. He divided civilization into pre-computing and post-computing eras, and
emphasized that very few of our actions today are done without Internet
assistance. He asked the audience to consider how even the most mundane
actions we perform today online are superpowers when compared to the
capabilities of the pre-computing era. We are giving computers more privileged
access to our daily lives, our daily communications, and our relationships.
Juan wrapped all of this up in the statement that we don’t know where the
world will be in 80 years, and it is prudent of us to solve the issues with
the Internet today in order to best set ourselves up for whatever the future
may hold.

> “Filecoin’s mission is to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust
> foundation for humanity’s information.”

Juan closed off by encouraging the Filecoin community to take ownership of the
network and take it to the next level.

#### 3 challenges:

  1. Bring deeply valuable data to the network.
  2. Build a new application using Filecoin technology.
  3. Make Filecoin yours.

#### 3 pieces of advice:

  1. Build something people want.
  2. Always think long term.
  3. Be resilient.

### 🌏 The ultimate goal is to

make life better for people

Juan Benet and Dan Boneh, Stanford Professor of applied cryptography, talked
about the future of cryptography with blockchain technology and Filecoin. Juan
asked what the most important technological innovation would be for
cryptography in the next 15-20 years. Dan stepped away from the specifics of
cryptography and said that the most important role any technology could play
is to make life better for people. In particular, he emphasized the importance
of private conversations, and the need to ensure we protect those
conversations from being policed.

### ♻️ Until now, most blockchain networks

have been (purposefully) wasteful.

Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-wee gave his talk “The Decentralized
Cloud is Here.” He explained the importance and innovation of the Filecoin
network by comparing it to well-known blockchain networks like Bitcoin. Most
blockchain networks that require “work” to arrive at consensus are
purposefully designed to be wasteful. Bitcoin’s hashpower, for example, can
only be used to mine bitcoin. There is no other way a person, company, or
government could use Bitcoin’s “work” - a successful, if wasteful, method to
ensure security. Filecoin, however, through FIL, its staking architecture, and
its storage marketplace, combines incentives to ensure the work being done on
the network is in the overall benefit of the decentralized storage economy.
This “tying of economic work function with distributed file storage network”
is fundamental to Filecoin’s future success.

### 🏆 The Golden Age of DAOs is around the corner.

Later in his presentation, Carlson-wee discussed the importance Filecoin and
decentralized storage will play in the evolution of DAOs. For much of
blockchain technology’s history, financial primitives have been some of the
easiest forms of logic to code into smart contracts. DeFi is a prime example
of how robust that use case has been. DAOs have been built to oversee and
govern these finance-forward applications. Building more complex and “web-
like” applications, however, is distinctly more difficult. Ethereum’s smart
contracts, for example, do not easily serve up files like media/images/videos
to users. With the Filecoin network live, smart contract platforms like
Ethereum can easily and natively serve up those files to end users. What we
are likely to see is a new wave of not just DeFi applications, but
applications that feel a lot more like the web applications we’re used to
today, with their robustness and complexity. These applications too will be
overseen and governed by a new wave of DAOs. This is what Carlson-wee referred
to as the “Golden Age of DAOs” we might see in the near future.

### Join us today!

Today, day 2 of Liftoff Week, is focused on **Mining on Filecoin**. It’s a day
full of talks, demos, and workshops focused on what the value of Filecoin is
to miners and what information they need to know to continue (or start)
participating in the network. A preview of the agenda:

  * **11am PDT:** Kick off day 2 with “Filecoin Proofs and Upcoming Improvements”, a presentation with Kelly Olson and Sean Gulley of Supranational and Dignifiedquire of Protocol Labs
  * **12pm PDT:** “Filecoin Mining for Solo Miners”, a detailed workshop for individual miners with Filecoin miner, Benjamin Hoesjbo
  * **3:30pm PDT:** Join Jacques Swanepoel of StorageHive and Neo Ge, co-founder of IPFSMain for their “Filecoin Mining Hardware & Architecture” talk as they take you through their setups and architecture and discuss some of the things to consider and avoid when constructing your rigs.
  * **5:20pm PDT:** Join some of Filecoin’s top global miners to learn how they won Space Race at the “How We Won the Space Race” panel
  * **7:05pm PDT:** “Filecoin Security and Bug Bounty Program” with Deep Kapur and David Dias of Protocol Labs

Filecoin is an open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and incentive
layer.
