## Team AKASHA: Martin Etzrodt

By [Martin Etzrodt](/blog/author/martin-etzrodt/)

August 07, 2019

The Department for Biosystems Engineering of the ETH Zurich is an unlikely
place to expect blockchain startups to emerge. Yet in 2016 two former
colleagues of mine, a neuroscientist and a biophysicist, did exactly this. It
took about six months until I myself also fell into that rabbit hole. It
wasn‚Äôt because of the ICO hype though.

One day, when I was struggling with data analysis for my research project, it
struck me how amazing it could be, if we could not only transact ‚Äúmoney,‚Äù but
also bits of information like ‚Äúpieces of knowledge.‚Äù After all they carry
value, yet it seemed until now incredibly difficult to capture that. I felt
that blockchain could offer the solution for this. About that time I had also
begun to follow the Ethereum Community on their favored social media outlets.
It struck this academic scientist with envy to observe how the young leaders
in the field were using Twitter, GitHub, and blog posts to communicate and
progress at an unprecedented pace with their discoveries, while I, on the
other hand, was drafting yet another manuscript for a scientific publisher,
not even knowing for sure when it would see the light of the day - and in what
distorted form.

How many opportunities had passed? How much time had I wasted? How many
academic scientists everyday were struggling, because they can not communicate
openly and effectively because the only way they can receive the recognition
to pay their salary is THAT paper they need to publish? My manuscript would
have zero impact to the advancement of my community for the next months or
even years. My world just began to make no more sense, whilst the alternative
became more and more appealing.

Then, one night sorting stem cells deep down in the basement of the
institute‚Äôs facility, as single cells in tiny picoliter droplets were flying
into tubes to form nothing other than a small, almost invisible pellet - the
result of a whole day‚Äôs worth of work - I found myself watching the AKASHA
Team's Cancun presentation.

cytometer in action._

Soon after, in January 2017 I posted parts of my laboratory notebook with some
routine procedures and descriptions on AKASHA. This was perhaps the first
self-sovereign ‚Äúscientific‚Äù publication on the network at the time, and may
well still be üòâ

science-related posts on AKASHA, here a couple of fluorescently-labelled stem
cells._

A couple of days later I found myself in a chat on our Discord group and then
on a call with Mihai. That is how my journey with AKASHA began, but it would
take more than another year and a half until I finally left academia and,
following a brief detour to a friend‚Äôs startup, I ended up joining the AKASHA
Team.

first calls with Mihai in spring 2018._

This is a very exciting journey. You can judge from the pictures and my story
that I am not necessarily joining with a strong background in computer
science, cryptography, or economics. No day passes that I am not still
learning from my amazing colleagues, each of them extremely talented in their
different professional skills they bring to the AKASHA Foundation.

My contribution is focussed predominantly on exploring and critically
questioning whether the promises the new technologies at hand bring, and that
we are all so excited about, can be indeed translated into applications. I
help the team to navigate also through the traditional ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù space and
create bridges to academia and its traditional ways of operation. This work is
useful as we seek to expand our knowledge, adding talent where it is needed in
order to realize our mission of ‚Äúunlocking potential through open systems that
expand our collective minds at local, regional, and global scales.‚Äù

talented physicist and colleague of mine Dr. Gotthold Flaeschner at the lounge
of ETH Zurich, another one who has fallen into the blockchain rabbit hole._

While this is all super cool, there is one thing I regret: My kids keep
telling me that my new job is pretty darn boring: ‚ÄúAll day you sit in front of
your computer and talk to people.‚Äù So, let‚Äôs make sure that the we keep
working hard and succeed with this, eventually making this planet a way more
exciting place! There is so much more to discover. In the meantime, I am
prepping my own kitchen-science laboratory at home‚Ä¶
