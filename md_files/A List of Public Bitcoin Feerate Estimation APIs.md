##  A List of Public Bitcoin Feerate Estimation APIs

#####

Saturday, June 29, 2019

My search for a list of public Bitcoin feerate estimation APIs ended without
any real results. [Jameson Lopp](https://twitter.com/lopp) has a section on
feerate estimators on his [bitcoin.page](https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-
information/fee-estimates.html) and [Antoine Le
Calvez's](https://twitter.com/khannib) dashboard
[txstats.com](https://txstats.com/dashboard/db/fee-estimation) provides a
visualization of different estimation APIs. But that is not what I was looking
for. That's why I compiled this list.

I opted to only include publicly advertised feerate estimation APIs by e.g.
payment processors and block explorers. I'm purposefully leaving out list APIs
by wallets, such as Mycelium and Trezor because their APIs are not publicly
advertised. Additionally, I'm leaving out Bitcoin Core's feerate estimates via
the [`estimatesmartfee`
RPC](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/0.18.0/rpc/util/estimatesmartfee/). I
don't consider the RPC publicly reachable as in _reachable over the web by
everyone_ (some [services](https://wasabiwallet.io/swagger/index.html) wrap
the `estimatesmartfee` RPC however).

The following list of public feerate APIs is lexicographically sorted.

* * *

### bitcoiner.live API

The [bitcoiner.live](https://bitcoiner.live/) API provides `sat/vByte`
estimates for confirmation in half an hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours,
12 hours and 24 hours. It's reachable under
[`https://bitcoiner.live/api/fees/estimates/latest`](https://bitcoiner.live/api/fees/estimates/latest).

    
    
    {
      "timestamp": 1563456789,
      "estimates": {
        "30": {
          "sat_per_vbyte": 12.0,
          [ ... ]
        },
        "60": {
          "sat_per_vbyte": 12.0,
          [ ... ]
        },
        "120": {
          "sat_per_vbyte": 8.0,
          [ ... ]
        },
        [ ... ]
      }
    }

### BitGo API

Bitgo's feerate API is reachable under

and there is documentation available
[here](https://bitgo.com/api/v2/#operation/v2.tx.getfeeestimate). The API
returns estimates for different block targets in **`sat/kB`**. ( _`sat/kB /
1000 = sat/Byte`_ )

    
    
    {
      "feePerKb": 61834,
      "cpfpFeePerKb": 61834,
      "numBlocks": 2,
      "confidence": 80,
      "multiplier": 1,
      "feeByBlockTarget": {
        "1": 64246,
        "2": 61834,
        "3": 56258,

[`https://insight.bitpay.com/api/utils/estimatefee?nbBlocks=2,4,6`](https://insight.bitpay.com/api/utils/estimatefee?nbBlocks=2,4,6).
With the parameter `nbBlocks` the confirmation target in the next _`n`_ blocks
can be specified. Feerates are in **`BTC/kB`**. _(`BTC/kB x 100000 =
sat/Byte`)_

    
    
    {

      },
      [ ... ]
    }
    

* * *

### BlockCypher API

The BlockCypher API includes a `low`, `medium` and `high` feerate estimate in
[`https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main`](https://api.blockcypher.com/v1/btc/main).
The feerates are in **`sat/kB`**. ( _`sat/kB / 1000 = sat/Byte`_ )

    
    
    {
      [ ... ]
      "high_fee_per_kb": 41770,
      "medium_fee_per_kb": 25000,

estimates`](https://blockstream.info/api/fee-estimates). The API is documented
[here](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#fee-

#### The Incomplete History of Bitcoin Development

To fully understand the rationale behind the current state of Bitcoin
development, knowledge about historical events is essential. This blog post
highlights selected historical events, software releases and bug fixes before
and after Satoshi left the project. It additionally contains a section about
the current state of Bitcoin development. The linked
[timeline](/projects/bitcoin-dev-history/#timeline-bitcoin-history) provides
extra detail for each event.

#### Plotting the Bitcoin Feerate Distribution

How did the median Bitcoin feerate evolve [from 2013 to
2015?](https://transactionfee.info/charts/feerate/median?avg=7&step=false&start=2013-01-01&end=2015-01-01)
When were the [feerate spikes in
2017?](https://transactionfee.info/charts/feerate/percentiles?avg=7&step=false&start=2017-01-01&end=2018-01-01)
Visualizing the Bitcoin feerate distribution per block was on my todo list
since I've started working on the first version of my [mempool.observer
project](/projects/mempool-observer-2017-version/) in mid-2017. But acquiring
the data wasn't as easy as I first thought.
