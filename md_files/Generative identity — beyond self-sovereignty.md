* * *

I'm going to outline three ways to think about _digital identity_ to help move
the conversation forward in line with [the AKASHA Foundation's
purpose](https://akasha.org/about/). I'm not claiming any neat taxonomy per
se, just exploring very different degrees of nuance with radically distinct
implications.

  1. Relating to how personal and group identity is manifest online, **naively**
  2. Relating to how personal and group identity is manifest online, **expertly**
  3. Relating to how we might employ digital technologies to transform society's accommodations of and approaches to identity, **generatively**.

## Naively

It seems from observation alone that quite a few technologists work in this
mode, excited to be bringing pre-digital bureaucratized identity into the
digital age.

[Telegram Passport](https://telegram.org/blog/passport) is an exemplar of the
naive unfortunately, a service allowing you to upload your "real-life ID" just
the once so you may offer up such documentation more easily in the future as
and when required by third-party services. Simple? Yes. Convenient?
Undoubtedly. With dire emergent consequences? Quite possibly.

["Your papers, please"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_papers,_please) is
a cultural metaphor for living in a police state, and Telegram technologists
are diligently removing the systemic frictions of the pre-digital era to
assist your compliance, misguidedly assuming that friction is something that
should always be eliminated I suppose.

You may be tempted to dismiss such a concern … _But I decide when to present
my ID!_

Well not quite. Consider the [Barnes
Paradox](https://firstmonday.org/article/view/1394/1312) whereby individuals
transgress their own privacy preferences just to get to the stuff a click
away. We've all done it. Moreover, each of us is just one of very many agents
in the constant emergent reformation of societal structures; in other words,
many if not most of your fellow citizens would have to exercise similar
discipline. Still confident?

The only way to feel positive when it comes to naive digital identity is by
assuming lawmakers will step in to constrain the types of entities that may
request ID in such a manner, and to constrain the corresponding purposes too.
Such a license to operate would be cryptographically provable by the
requesting party.

But please do not rely on this to ease your mind as you write more naive code.
Under the influence of the false dichotomy of _privacy .v. security_ , or
guided by similarly naive understanding of identity, governments appear too
frequently to be pulling in the wrong direction here. India's
[Aadhaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar) is a case in point. This
alarmingly-naive, government-funded invention was intended to be entirely
voluntary, but to opt-out now is to effectively opt-out of living in the
country; an example of the structuration I referenced above.

The thought put into Aadhaar's goals, design and consequences has been and
remains woefully inadequate.

Naive innovation represents an inordinate and perilous transformation of the
ilk explored in mid-twentieth century dystopian novels. In other words, people
will die if its application is not controlled. But controlling it will also
lead to exclusion, persecution, and deaths depending on the dogma of those in
power at the time. (See [India's hunt for "illegal immigrants" is aimed at
Muslims](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/07/11/indias-hunt-for-illegal-
immigrants-is-aimed-at-muslims).) As I note in my [webinar for the Self-
Sovereign Identity Meetup](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/04/01/ssimeetup-
webinar), engineering the facility for inclusion cannot but also enable
exclusion.

Brevity is my only reason for limiting the examples here to Telegram and
Aadhaar. They are not too unusual in their naivety, unfortunately. Just use
your preferred search engine to look up "KYC-as-a-service" and "e-KYC" for
example and challenge yourself to find a service that limits its application
to legally-necessitated situations, or one that doesn't use legal terms and
conditions to curtail hackers' freedom to find flaws in its system.

If this has sparked your deeper interest, _Dissent on Aadhaar_1 is perhaps the
definitive read on Aadhaar's architectural flaws, its erosion of civil
liberties, undermining of the democratic process, negative impact on welfare
programmes, and pivotal role in the formation of a surveillance state.
Separately, Kaliya Young explores how Aadhaar differs from the US Social
Security System2 and concludes: "there tends to be insufficient consideration
of the ways in which the proposed solutions that use Aadhaar might create
risks for those individuals and institutions it intends to serve."

## Expertly

Identity experts are semantic pedantic — their professional focus is
distinction after all. I adopt Jonathan Donner's recommendation3 to
distinguish the terms "identity", "identification", and "ID". Identity
"implies a kind of multidimensional social location of an individual relative
to other people and institutions around him or her." Identification is a
claims verification process, and ID is an artifact, traditionally tangible,
that "supports a claim or signals that identification might be possible."

In other words, identity ≠ identification ≠ ID. Any and every conversation in
which participants recognize this distinction is massively more productive.
And there's another phrase …

### Self-sovereign identity (SSI)

SSI is the current state of the art. The concept and term emerged in 2016
having morphed from "sovereign source authority" in 2012. Here is an extract
from Devon Loffreto's argument for such sovereignty4:

> Society is an Agreement. It is made by and between Individuals. Within any
> Society, Individuals have an established Right to an "identity", and to all
> of the benefits and responsibilities of some form of "Nationally Sovereign
> Structure" of governance and administration. Sovereign Source Authority
> (SSA) refers to the actual default design parameter of Human identity, prior
> to the "registration" process used to inaugurate participation in Society.

The motivation here is valid at least, evidenced in the analysis of the
conditions by which totalitarianism took hold in Europe in the 1930s and early
40s5:

> The stateless and the minorities … had no governments to represent and to
> protect them. … The very phrase ‘human rights' became for all concerned —
> victims, persecutors, and onlookers alike — the evidence of hopeless
> idealism or fumbling feeble-minded hypocrisy.

When only states are sovereign, the individual rendered stateless has no
rights. This is unacceptable and led to the [Universal Declaration of Human
Rights](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html)
in 1948 and more recently to the inclusion under the Sustainable Development
Goals of the target to ensure everyone has a legal identity by 20306.

We are also moved by the motivations for such a target and recognise that
there are choices to be made of how best to achieve it, and indeed to define
precisely what _it_ is. Is it to serve only in tightly specified legal or
humanitarian contexts for example? If so, who gets to decide? And who gets to
decide who gets to decide?7 We must remain cognizant that efficient identity
related bureaucracy was also fatal in the 1940s8. It was easier to find people
to murder in jurisdictions in which legal identity worked well. On which
point, the minimum qualification of an expert in this field must be historical
awareness and dedication to not repeating its tragedies.

I'm not going to offer an introduction to SSI nor the corresponding
deliberations by various communities, not least [Rebooting the Web of
Trust](https://www.weboftrust.info/), [Internet Identity
Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/), [Identity
Foundation](http://identity.foundation/), [ID2020](https://id2020.org), and
[Good ID](https://www.good-id.org/). Rather, the following resources are
excellent introductions if you need to jump off here.

  * [The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) (includes "Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity"), Christopher Allen, April 2016
  * [What is self-sovereign Identity?](https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/), Sovrin, 2018
  * [Self-sovereign identity: Unraveling the terminology](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2018/06/self-sovereign-identity-unraveling-the-terminology/), IBM, 2018
  * [The Three Models of Digital Identity Relationships](https://medium.com/evernym/the-three-models-of-digital-identity-relationships-ca0727cb5186), Timothy Ruff, Evernym, 2018

Given that I will be taking aim at the founding principles, I will just tip my
hat to _The Laws of Identity_9 from 2005. As Kim Cameron explained at the
time10, the word "laws" was adopted in the scientific sense of hypotheses
about the world — resulting from observation — which can be tested and are
thus disprovable. The influence of these laws on the SSI principles is plain,
not least user control.

The transition to SSI from the prior state of play (described succinctly by
Christopher Allen in the first link in the list above) represents a
substantial and most welcome breakthrough, but my focus here is its fatal
flaws — some of its ‘laws' don't stand the test — and where we might go beyond
SSI.

### Not how the world works

The Rebooting Web of Trust community adopts what it describes as [a functional
approach to
identity](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-
and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md):

> Identity is how we recognize, remember, and ultimately respond to specific
> people and things.

It's a multidimensional social location of an individual relative to others,
and clearly contextual. We might recognise faces, voices, gaits, fingerprints,
irises, handwriting, usernames, email addresses, PINs, cookies, cryptographic
keys or the mathematical proofs of their application, etc. We might remember
by close personal association, by faint to robust recollection, by paper
record, by database and algorithm. And our responses will be influenced by our
interpretation of the associated archived information and the current
informational context.

The definition emphasizes the observer rather than the observed, the
recognizer rather than the recognized. Identity is in the eye of the
beholder11. It's social.

On the other hand, the term SSI denotes that identity emanates from the
individual in question under that individual's control — after all, to be
sovereign means to possess the supreme or ultimate power, and control is both
a formative law and founding principle here. SSI is then individualistic,
atomistic, and definitely not reliant on anything social.

But how could this reflect reality? How could this be possible when I have
minority influence over others' recognizing me as best they might, remembering
me as they so desire, and responding to me as they see fit? I may attempt to
minimize information disclosure, and I may have some recourse under law to
effectively reverse previous disclosures, but while that is all well and good
in the name of privacy, identities still form in the eyes of the beholders
beyond my control. Timothy Ruff puts it tentatively12:

> … connections, relationships, and third-party issued credentials are not
> entirely self-sovereign, nor should they be. They represent (at least) two-
> sided relationships, and the other party to the relationship has some degree
> of control, too.

I'm more blunt, and perhaps the easiest explanation is one of _reductio ad
absurdum_.

Imagine if you will that I am self-sovereign. Imagine that I exercise my self-
sovereignty fully in the only direction afforded me — i.e. I refuse any
facility that others might wield to recognize, remember and respond to me.
(For the more technical reader here, I might take full advantage of pairwise
pseudonymity with efficient zero-knowledge proofs and ‘tumblers' that
obfuscate my true service endpoints13.)

I am now maxing my self-sovereignty.

Is this then the ultimate identity power play? Should you then consider me to
be in full control of my identity? In short no, of course not, for who then is
left to make the distinction? What is it I'm now supposedly controlling? I am
left with no identity at all.

Identity cannot be self-sovereign by the functional definition.

This could be a straightforward case of poor word choice — I'm not the first
to make that observation14 — but this goes deeper than the label. This
contradiction, this impossibility, is set up from the underlying principles.

A quote from the anthropologist, social scientist, and cyberneticist Gregory
Bateson springs to mind15:

> The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how
> nature works and the way people think.

Phil Windley has observed such a tension, up to a point16:

> Many people hear sovereign and think "sovereign means the individual has
> complete control." Not really. As Scott David pointed out, "declaring
> yourself king of a deserted island isn't very useful."
>
> Sovereignty is about relationships and boundaries. … Sovereignty defines a
> boundary, within which the sovereign has complete control and outside of
> which the sovereign relates to others within established rules and norms.

I argue from the perspectives of complexity science and sociology (not
unrelated of course) that not only are many of the SSI principles false — they
don't reflect how the world works — but even this attempt at reconciliation
entails clean boundary lines that simply don't exist. But Windley concludes:

> The beauty of sovereignty isn't complete and total control, but rather
> balance of power that leads to negotiations about the nature of the
> relationships between various entities in the system.

This isn't sovereignty, or the "beauty of sovereignty". By my reading, Windley
suspects that identity isn't about sovereignty at all.

And last year, when learning to become a certified [Warm
Data](https://hackernoon.com/warm-data-9f0fcd2a828c) Lab host, I found a
kindred spirit in Matthew Schutte who had already critiqued the SSI
principles17. I won't take on every principle here — just four should do the
job, starting in each case with a quote from Matthew's critique and
contributing my own notes.

**_SSI principle: Existence. Users must have an independent existence._**

> This is the first false assumption: The belief in an identity as an object.
> The perception of an "I" is a heuristic that simplifies information
> processing and decision making, but it is not an underlying reality that we
> should be anchoring Identity processes to — at least not in total.

I dislike the reference to "users" in this principle. Rather, let's talk about
human beings i.e. recognise our full potential and dignity in ways not
necessarily triggered let alone encouraged by the word "users."

Furthermore, and as [I've written
before](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/17/interpersonal-data-1-of-3), the _I_
and the _we_ are not really separable. Neither the individual nor the
collectivity can _be_ or _become_ without the other, an assertion recognised
by structuration theory in sociology. The theory, dominant in its field, moves
away from treating the individual (agent) and society (structure) as separate,
paired elements, to considering the two as interdependent, no longer separate
or opposed18:

> the structural properties of social systems are both medium and outcome of
> the practices they recursively organize.

Comprehending such complexity requires some shifts in thinking, including:

  * Away from the reductionism of ‘parts and wholes' towards the simultaneity of a thing being both a part and a whole (holonic philosophy)
  * Away from a focus on the agents (nodes, things, groups) towards a focus on the relationships (the edges, dynamics, liminality, interdependencies), per [Actor-Network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory), and ultimately in my view to rhizomes19 and agencement20 — the continuous and unending flux of assembling and reassembling.

Unlike SSI, these appear to correspond to how identity works in the world. I
acknowledge of course that the law has a concept of identity for narrowly-
bounded legal applications, but that's the point — narrowly-bounded — and
heuristic to boot, to quote Matthew Schutte. In the countries I'm most
familiar with, in Western Europe and North America, there is no need to
reference a legal identity to grab a cab, buy a bagel, meet-up with a mate,
borrow a book, play in the park, or do a friend a favour. We act around group
norms, simultaneously affecting their perceived loci and boundaries, telling
and enacting different stories to ourselves and others, and playing different
parts with different people in different contexts, all of which are identity
related without our necessarily thinking or believing them as such, and all of
which would be alien to the designer of a legal ID system. (I explore identity
narratives later.)

Or to put it another way, designing for ‘proof of personhood' to engineer
[sybil resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) is critical in
some contexts of course, but only a minority of identity contexts. It would be
harmful in other contexts. (See _[Verifying identity as a social
intersection](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/05/22/verifying-identity-as-a-
social-intersection)_.)

**_SSI principle: Control. Users must control their identity._**

> This assumes that 1) "identities" are a static referent, 2) identities are
> maintained at a system wide scale. These claims align with past attempts at

Thanks Matthew.

Control is wholly inappropriate in the context of identity because it is a
logical impossibility. But that's not to advocate or resign ourselves to the
binary opposite. Far from it. Anthony Giddens, the progenitor of structuration
theory, has something to add here21:

> Agency refers not to the intentions people have in doing things but to their
> capability of doing those things in the first place. ... To be able to 'act
> otherwise' means being able to intervene in the world, or to refrain from
> such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or
> state of affairs.

As [I've noted before](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/01/23/interpersonal-
data-3-of-3), agency (in co-evolving structure) entails a negotiation in and
with the world that the word "control" denies. Identities form and reform (and
expire) in the course of individuals exercising or not exercising agency, all
the while sending and receiving signals to use Matthew's words. We can strive
to enhance agency, perhaps spread it around a bit more evenly, but to frame
identity in terms of control is to promise something that cannot be delivered.

In a related email discussion, Elizabeth Renieris notes22:

> The [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
> is a classic example of a law that is being misinterpreted by the SSI
> community as having to do with individual control. Notice how the core GDPR

**_SSI principle: Access. Users must have access to their own data._**

To have unimpeded access is to have control, which cannot work when one
appreciates that so-called personal data and identity are reciprocally
defining and co-constitutive (more on which later). The use of "their own"
here invokes the idea that data be treated as property (if only perhaps for
lack of imagination). I have written at some length on the impracticality and
immorality of total access to / control over / ownership of personal data23
and I won't repeat that here. I will however invite you to use the expressions
"data about me" and "data about us" rather than "my data" and "our data" to
avoid any implication of ownership.

Matthew doesn't address the digitalization of associated processes, but I do
below.

**_SSI principle: Persistence. Identities must be long-lived._**

Identity doesn't come with persistence as a defining characteristic. I have
yet to find a similar ‘law' in the corpus of sociology, cultural studies, or
psychology; the opposite in fact. Law is the only discipline that necessarily
bureaucratizes birth and death with some urgency to connect the two, and has
been narrowly constrained in application as noted.

Of course, digital technologies have effectively given some observers
superhuman powers of recognizing, remembering, and responding. While
developers of SSI related technologies might design to attenuate such powers,
such intention doesn't justify the terminology of "self-sovereignty" or its
founding principles. Fundamentally, superhuman technologies are established,
around which societal norms have formed and will continue to form, as
[Marshall McLuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan) famously
observed. In the context here, this leaves only the law as the basis to trim
those super powers in the name of enduring social norms, and in practice it is
more the (corporate) observer that extends or accommodates technology in
seeking legal compliance than it is any technology of purely self-sovereign
origin having the desired effect.

## Generatively

I have discussed how personal and group identity is manifest online, both
naively and expertly. Now I'm going to explore how we might employ digital
technologies to transform society's accommodations of and approaches to
identity, generatively.

I have never attempted to engineer self-sovereign identity. I am then no SSI
expert. I invest my time working out how we might wield digital technologies
to nurture the full potential of human beings, realizing intelligences that
would otherwise remain hidden, and creating regenerative cultures and
systems24. In the context here, my focus can be called Generative identity.

It's not an easy domain to communicate, so I welcome any interest you might
have in conversation and collaboration.

My use of generative relates to a desired state beyond sustainability25:

  * Sustainable — aiming not to leave anything in worse state (i.e. it's "less bad"26)
  * Restorative — doing things to assist the evolution of natural sub-systems
  * Regenerative — participating as nature; co-evolution of the whole system.

It also relates to Jonathan Zittrain's use in technological terms27:

> Generativity denotes a technology's overall capacity to produce unprompted
> change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences… Generativity is
> a function of a technology's capacity for leverage across a range of tasks,
> adaptability to a range of different tasks, ease of mastery, and
> accessibility.

Generativity may be designed into a digital architecture "through loose
couplings across layers whereby innovations can spring up independently at any
layer, leading to cascading effects on other layers."28

The book _Designing Regenerative Cultures_29 opens with this Albert Einstein
quote:

> If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I
> would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for
> once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five
> minutes.

Generative identity is most definitely in the "determining the proper question
to ask" phase. Let's start with the question — what do we mean by "self"?

### The narrative self

Marya Schechtman argues that we each maintain numerous narratives in multiple
contexts that evolve reflexively with our interactions30:

> the complexity of selves is to be found in the multiple perspectives on our
> lives that we negotiate in living them, a complexity best understood in
> narrative terms.

The title of an article by Daniel Dennett31 puts it succinctly: _Why Everyone
is a Novelist_.

Richard Sorabji notes that Schechtman stresses the continuing and interacting
nature of an individual's activities — "talking, listening, walking, acting,
having beliefs, desires, goals, intentions, thinking, being inconsistent, and
vacillating."32 The narratives are mostly accretive, but may also on occasion
undergo sharp change.

Identities are formed through narrative. Narratives are informed by
interactions with others. Interactions are modulated by identities. In other
words, there are no absolutes here. Nothing is concrete. Everything is
agencement. An individual is an agencement with her narratives. A group is an
agencement of individuals and distinct and shared and conflicting narratives.

Michel Callon connects these arrangings and organizings to the very potential
to act and interact33.

> [Agency] can neither be contained in a human being nor localized in the
> institutions, norms, values, and discursive or symbolic systems assumed to
> produce effects on individuals. Action, including its reflexive dimension
> that produces meaning, takes place in hybrid collectives comprising human
> beings as well as material and technical devices, texts, etc.

### An ecology

The next two paragraphs and the following quote are perhaps the trickiest
elements to follow here, but I do my best to offer an explanation immediately
after.

All conceptualizations of identity and their corresponding perceived
manifestations entail minds working with information. Gregory Bateson pointed
out that the learning in both instances develops as a hierarchic series
"constructed by successive use of the word 'about,' or 'meta.'" Moreover, on
considering "phenomena marginal to communications theory, similar hierarchies
may be constructed by the piling up of 'change' upon 'change'."34

On seeking to contrast these — orders of learning, and contexts, and contexts
of contexts — Bateson concludes that they could only be considered separate
should the first be located inside the individual and the second located
outside.

> But in the communicational world, this dichotomy is irrelevant and
> meaningless. The contexts have communicational reality only insofar as they
> are effective as messages, i.e., insofar as they are represented or
> reflected (correctly or with distortion) in multiple parts of the
> communication system which we are studying; and this system is not the
> physical individual but a wide network of pathways of messages.

This finding explains Bateson's adoption of the term "ecology of minds." In
plain terms, your brain and your mind are not the same thing. The brain is
what's in here [taps skull] whereas the mind is a distributed, social
phenomenon. The brain is biological. The mind is informational and inseparable
from informational contexts.

In seeking difference and therefore similarity, inclusion and therefore
exclusion, varying conceptualizations of identity may draw boundaries and
boundaries of boundaries, with ready potential for apparent contradiction. (It
would be more surprising if there were none, and such apparent contradictions
keep those working on digital identity entertained in debate for very many
hours!) Nevertheless, "the characteristics of the system are in no way
dependent upon any boundary lines which we may superpose upon the
communicational map."

At some moments in time, in some contexts, in some epistemologies, perceptions
of boundary lines may emerge for those seeking epistemological insight or
those labouring under some desire for some expressed mode of societal
governance or organization, but this doesn't change the system because the
system Bateson describes encompasses such learnings, such actions, and such
contexts. They are part of the ecology.

The idea, discussed earlier, that SSI might delimit a clear boundary within
which the sovereign has control is a case in point here. This isn't how the
world works but rather how this interpretation of SSI would have it work.

### Towards mechanism design

Evolution hasn't left us with innate facility for systems thinking — it just
hasn't been core to our adaptation. And yet we are now the first species, that
we know of anyway, to confront the need to cooperate as a species on a system
of global scale.

Bateson argued that there are some conditions under which our current
civilization and our environment might co-exist in a state of ecological
health. In classic cybernetic formulation, and following Ross Ashby, he
identified that there are varying freedoms and constraints (flexibility) of
variables in a complex adaptive system by which we may realise societally
valued outcomes in terms of ecological sustainability. He contemplated the
need for either a "high" civilization or well-educated planners.

A "high" civilization is defined in part by its facility to maintain the
necessary wisdom in the human population to understand the requisite variables
and corresponding flexibilities. While I would never dismiss such aspiration,
far from it, it doesn't appear to be realistic within the short time we have
to reset the trajectory here35. (Being ignorant of everything other than my
own infinitesimal niche, how arrogant would it be to require everyone else to
learn my expertise given I have insufficient bandwidth to learn theirs? Or is
that proposition itself arrogant?)

While not offering similar doubts explicitly, Bateson leaned towards the well-
educated planners route — a.k.a. mechanism design — approaching system design
such that its operation by and corresponding incentives offered to those
involved are such that the system trends towards a desired state. Mechanism
design has traditionally assumed rational participation ([homo
economicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus)) but increasingly
encompasses understanding of our irrationality assembled under the rubric of
[behavioural economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics),
becoming known as behavioural mechanism design.

Entertaining behavioural mechanism design here raises the question:

> _Are some conceptualizations of identity (boundary drawing and redrawing)
> more conducive than others to the recovery and maintenance of ecological
> health, to generativity?_

In overly simplistic but perhaps more memorable terms, could people more
readily self-identify as astronauts on Spaceship Earth36?

### All change

We have then arrived at the first principle for generative identity based on
the imperative to support continuous ecological adaptation.

**_Generative identity principle: Change. Generative identity facilitates and
maintains freedom of application, freedom of agencement, and freedom to revise
generative identity._**

As Buckminster Fuller anticipated in _I Seem to be a Verb_37 and as I've tried
to explicate here, _who I am_ encompasses a constant flux of informational
diffusion and intermixing, interfacial constructions and experiences,
continuously revised narratives, arrangings and organizings.

In my [webinar for the SSI
Meetup](https://akasha.org/blog/2019/04/01/ssimeetup-webinar) I distinguish
between noun-like and verb-like conceptualizations of identity. The noun-like
are unchanging by design — think of those developed for the legal
bureaucratization of identity (e.g. birth certificate, passport, national ID
card, social security number, Aadhaar identity number), those based on
permanent physical features (e.g. fingerprint, face recognition), and those
inventions vying to achieve similar permanence or based on such permanence
(e.g. Facebook ID, Telegram passport).

The primary characteristic of verb-like conceptualizations is their
accommodating and enabling change. They haven't been a focus of the digital
identity community to date. Indeed, the verb-like conceptualizations, while in
fact dominant in everyday life, appear to be so far removed from
technologists' beliefs and understanding of how identity works in the world
and from how digital technologies have developed to date that I find many have
a hard time grasping that such conceptualizations even exist.
Sociotechnologists on the other hand get it pretty quickly if not immediately
given their interdisciplinary focus (see [Web
Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_science)).

Noun-like identity conceptualizations lack adaptability by design. By deep
existential contrast, generative identity is essential to psychological,
societal, and ecological health.

**_Generative identity principle: Co-constitution. Identity and relationships
and information are reciprocally defining and co-constitutive._**

After Margaret Wheatley38, identity is the sense-making capacity of
organizing. It is of the selves that organize and the self that gets
organized. Narrative in nature, identities assemble in relationships involving
and producing personally and socially-material information.

Relationships are the pathways for organizing, required for the creation and
transformation of information, the expansion of the organizational identity,
and accumulation of wisdom. Relationships are formed with information exchange
between identifying / identifiable entities in identifying / identifiable
organizings.

Information is the medium of the organizing. Life uses information to organize
itself, i.e. when a system assigns meaning to data. Information is contextual
to identities in relationships.

(See _[The interpersonal data at the heart of all human digital systems,
including markets](https://medium.com/radicalxchange/the-interpersonal-data-
at-the-heart-of-all-human-digital-systems-including-markets-6316701184a9)_.)

But this doesn't appear from my experience to be how many computer scientists
and software engineers think. The design principle of [separation of
concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) has served the
discipline and profession well to date ‘lower in the stack', but its
application ‘higher in the stack' where human identity is involved and complex
adaptive systems reign must be subject to constant challenge. A presentation
at this summer's [DWeb Camp](https://dwebcamp.org/) for example proposes that
data and identity be considered orthogonal to / independent of each other39.
To be fair, although an indictment of itself, the conceptualisation of
identity adopted in the presentation remains completely undefined. This is
also not unusual. The idea that identity might be anything other than noun-
like, to use my terminology here, and anything much more advanced than the
substitution of a cryptographic key for tangible ID appears not yet to have
entered the mainstream conversation.

By corollary of the principle of co-constitution, we arrive at ...

**_Generative identity principle: Omni-directionality. There can be no
distinction of input or output — any data flow may have reflexive
consequence._**

By way of a trivial example, there is a connection between the series of
novels known as _Harry Potter_ and the writer _J. K. Rowling_. Each
'contributes' information to the other.

There is also a connection between the book _The Cuckoo 's Calling_ and the
writer _Robert Galbraith_. In this instance, the connection to the book was
all that was known about the writer. It defined Galbraith.

Of course, authoring a book is a big undertaking, and I want to stress that
the same goes for the smallest most fleeting actions and inactions.

**_Generative identity principle: Friction. Friction is an important system
property in any system, including generative identity._**

We learned subsequently of course that Rowling wrote under the Galbraith pen
name. The identity _Robert Galbraith_ still exists at the time of writing, but
when operating with a noun-like conceptualization of identity we might say
that it is absorbed into Rowling's and _Galbraith_ is demoted to a mere known
pseudonym.

Such collapses occur naturally but the rate at which collapses may occur when
subject to deliberate programmatic techniques (correlation) is a concern. In
the SSI webinar, I note that friction is an important system property. Failure
to re-engineer appropriate frictions in our sociotechnical system may lead to
very poor social outcomes. Existing work done in the name of SSI may prove
useful here (baby, bathwater), and I also believe this will likely require a
blend of legal and technical codes and appropriate revisions of social norms.

Given the co-constitution here, it's not surprising that a concern for
correlated identities applies equally to correlated relationships and
information. Take this fairly recent assertion40:

> Decentralized identity systems must allow us to present claims we make about
> ourselves (now called self-attested), but must allow us to present claims
> that express things others say about us too.

What's not to like about this additional feature?

Well, let's assume that we consider the idea of the [Chinese "social credit"
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System) — a state
surveillance system seeking to standardize the assessment of citizens'
economic and social reputation — an affront to individual freedoms many in the
West hold dear. Now imagine that anyone in the West can present claims that
express things others say about them. I suggest that you, just like almost
everyone else, will see self-interest in, for example, porting your eBay
seller rating to your Airbnb host profile. Instant reputation! And in fact it
soon becomes a qualifying expectation (structuration). Everyone's rational
self-interest works against our collective best interest, and an equivalent
"social credit" system forms by emergence almost as quickly as the Chinese
deliberate action and perhaps all the more efficiently.

SSI experts may clamour here to point out the ways in which the associated
technology does not set up this up. I will if I may just reiterate the point
that we're all working in a sociotechnological environment, not merely
technological, and therefore with structuration not just atomistic
individuals.

If we can procure omni-directionality with appropriate friction, we will be
well on the way to living up to the final principle in this draft list ...

**_Generative identity principle: Non-universality. One can have generativity
or universality but not both._**

Or to put it another way, the only universal attribute of generative identity
is that it does not trend toward universality. It must have a proclivity for
mutation by design, which also requires it to be resistant to homogenizing
network effects. Generative identity is a set of principles that may be
instantiated in different ways by different cultures, different
collectivities, different societies, at different times.

I appreciate that this one is going to be difficult for some people to accept,
especially those technologists working without the socio- prefix. If it helps
any, you'll appreciate that mutual understanding crystallizes as needed in a
context and fades as and when attentions are directed elsewhere. This is
perfectly natural. Now swap out "mutual understanding" for "interoperability."

## Generative identity at the AKASHA Foundation

AKASHA's purpose demands systems thinking, especially systems ecology and the
interdisciplinarity of web science, if not transdisciplinarity (emphasising
holism and synthesizing new bodies of knowledge with which to address complex
systems problems41).

In the spirit of our purpose, and from simple necessity, our purpose can only
be pursued in cooperation with many others, and that clearly includes the
identity ‘problem space'. We're excited to be playing a part, ready for
conversations and collaborations.

Concurrent to the thinking process reflected here, we're coding. Today, this
entails research into and experimentation with [decentralized
identifiers](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) (DIDs) led by [Andrei
Sambra](https://deiu.me/).

As you might imagine, even if you're not familiar with the term, the concept
of "identity provider" isn't exactly compatible with the generative identity
principles. But perhaps we may provide for holonic provision. Do keep an eye
on the [AKASHA blog](https://akasha.org/blog) for updates.

## Legal identity

I've noted that the conceptualization of generative identity remains
embryonic. We're only at the stage of determining the questions. Surely one of
the biggest question marks must be the ease with which noun-like and verb-like
conceptualizations might co-exist. Perhaps there's a future in which only the
latter are necessary, but a co-existence will be required for some good time
to get us that far.

It could be that the noun-like require entirely different protocols to the
verb-like, and rigorous effort is made to design appropriate and enduring
sociotechnological constraints to prevent the otherwise inevitable noun-like
creep.

Or perhaps a particular quality of verb-like instantiations enables it to
stabilise in similarly defined rare exception. I was presented with a word I
didn't previously know in a recent conversation with Jonathan Donner — gerund
— _a verb form which functions as a noun_. Who knew?!

Either way, at some point we have to answer the questions ... Who decides? And
who decides who decides? These questions are usually invoked to note a
weakness in the system. In this context however I also find some comfort in
the presumption that it will be humans at least. Let me explain by way of
finally bringing this post to a conclusion.

## One way or the other

I'm guided by fragmented glimpses of historical events, and I take inspiration
from the complexity of nature and our growing appreciation for the nature of
complexity. I am then enthusiastic for the sociotechnological potential here,
celebrating humanity, realizing intelligences that would otherwise remain
hidden, and creating regenerative cultures and systems.

Equally, I'm alarmed at the potential for psychological, societal, and
ecological harm should these draft principles of generative identity not be
developed and instantiated in abundant combinations of generative legal and
technical code and societal norms. I cannot conceive of a neutral alternative
… at least I cannot perceive any clues from nature for such. The alternative
is degenerative — tending to decline and deterioration.

Psychologically, our freedom of narrative will be eroded leaving only
enumerated subjects of network control42, or indeed "abjects" more than
subjects or objects43. In some contexts, physical safety will be the
individual's primary anxiety.

Societally, political doctrine is more likely to be rendered into technical
form. "Politics does not circulate just through the flow of ideologies or
rationalities of government, but through diagrams, instruments and
practices."44 Foucauldian disciplining will be writ large, with a "normalizing
gaze, a surveillance that makes it possible to qualify, to classify and to
punish"45, at which point the design problem becomes "to design and redesign
the User itself in the image of whatever program might enroll it."46

Ecologically, we won't be participating as nature, we won't be co-evolving
with the whole system. Rather, we will have become locked rigid together or
rigid apart. The structure, having subsumed agency, will crash into natural
systems with ever greater force until they can no longer sustain us.

In welcoming all conversation and debate about SSI and generative identity,
may I invite any ongoing champions of SSI to articulate how it might not
contribute to such tragic outcomes let alone help avoid them. That is likely
more than has been asked of SSI to date, but then this has got to be a good
part of the question.
