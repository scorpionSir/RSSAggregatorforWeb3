#  [Why Stake When You Can
Borrow?](/blog/2020/6/24/6vggzy8vfidunapjkeyt3eopc2jcbn)

June 25, 2020 [Alex Evans](/blog?author=5b5b175470a6ad84f141cd8d)

As smart contract platforms autonomously manage billions of dollars of
capital, quantifying the portfolio risk that investors engender in these
systems is increasingly important. Recent work illustrates that Proof of Stake
(PoS) is vulnerable to financial attacks arising from on-chain lending and has
worse capital efficiency than Proof of Work (PoW). Numerous methods for
improving capital efficiency have been proposed that allow stakers to create
fungible derivative claims on their staked assets. In this paper, we construct
a unifying model for studying the security risks of these proposals.

This model combines birth-death Pólya urn processes and risk models adapted
from the credit derivatives literature to assess token inequality and return
profiles. We find that there is a sharp transition between ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’
derivative usage. Surprisingly, we find that contrary to prior research there
exist conditions where derivatives can reduce concentration of wealth in these
networks. This model also applies to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols
where staked assets are used as insurance. Our theoretical results are
validated using agent-based simulation.
