# Power in Numbers: BRD Integrates Orchid’s Digital Currency (OXT)

Mar 23, 2020  
  

When it comes to privacy, Orchid believes in “power in numbers.” That’s why
we’re proud to share that [BRD Wallet](https://brd.com/) has integrated OXT,
Orchid’s digital currency, for its 3 million users in 171 countries.

Orchid is a unique VPN because it requires OXT to fund an account. VPN service
in the app is purchased with OXT from the connected account, and you pay only
for the bandwidth that you actually use. New Orchid users can open an account
by creating an Ethereum address using BRD and purchasing at least $4 in OXT
(you can [get it on Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/orchid)) and $1
of ETH. Once the account is created, a shareable QR code appears that contains
account credentials. Anyone can copy or scan that account into the app for a
1-step setup.

Dr. Steven Waterhouse, Orchid’s Co-Founder and CEO said: “BRD has built a huge
community of crypto enthusiasts, many of whom are committed to taking control
of their privacy. Now, they can access OXT and do exactly that. Privacy is a
community effort, and we’re thrilled to bridge our community with the strong
one that BRD has built.”
