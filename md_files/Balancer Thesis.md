_Note: Placeholder holds Balancer’s BAL._

Over the last year [pooled liquidity
protocols](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/4/9/defi-liquidity-models)
(AKA Automated Market Makers, or AMMs), which offer assets against algorithmic
curves as opposed to order books, have come to dominate DeFi activity. Despite
impressive liquidity and trading growth, the first generation of AMMs remain
relatively inflexible. To accommodate more users and strategies, AMMs will
have to evolve to offer both flexibility and depth, which is exactly
Balancer’s pursuit in building programmable and customizable liquidity pools.

Balancer is a new financial primitive that combines asset management and
decentralized exchange. For investors, Balancer currently offers indexed
management of cryptoassets [1]. Instead of paying fees to portfolio managers,
investors earn fees for contributing their assets to Balancer pools [2]. For
traders, Balancer is a permissionless and non-custodial trading venue with
competitive prices where the fees from trading increase returns for the asset
depositors. In conventional finance, this would be akin to smashing Fidelity
asset management together with NASDAQ’s exchange, funneling NASDAQ’s trading
profits to Fidelity’s asset holders.

This effect provides a powerful reinforcement mechanism that drives towards
having the most liquid pools of assets. The larger a Balancer pool gets, the
less slippage there is when someone is trying to source one of its assets.
With decreasing slippage for key assets, Balancer positions itself to attract
more traders as it becomes a more competitive venue for many of their desired
positions. Symbiotically, trading activity drives long-term value creation for
the asset depositors. And so a pool is incentivized to grow, and grow, and
grow.

And it’s working. Despite being around for only 4 months, Balancer already
offers highly competitive prices for trading popular assets such as MKR, REP,
LEND, mUSD, and many others. For example, a $13M [Balancer pool consisting of
60% MKR and 40%
ETH](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x9866772A9BdB4Dc9d2c5a4753e8658B8B0Ca1fC3)
is one of the most liquid venues for those looking to trade MKR with little
slippage, centralized or decentralized.

 _Being a supply-sider and governor in Balancer_

Balancer allows suppliers, commonly referred to as “liquidity providers”
(LPs), to deposit assets on their own terms. An LP can contribute to an
existing Balancer pool or create their own. In the process, LPs may choose
their preferred configuration of assets (any ERC-20 at the moment), pool
weights (%), and trading fees. This flexibility has allowed Balancer to be a
fertile ground for experimentation, alongside the deep liquidity pools it’s
accumulating ($200M and counting).

Balancer is intended to be owned and governed by its users. As part of that
commitment, [Balancer distributes BAL to active
LPs](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-liquidity-mining-
begins-6e65932eaea9) (the suppliers), with voting rights being passed on to
these suppliers over time. BAL is also available in the open market for
purchase, with its most liquid venue predictably being Balancer. Token holders
have the right to decide Balancer’s future, and how BAL itself will be used
over time.

The ongoing issuance of 145K BAL per week to LPs has contributed to Balancer’s
rapid growth, and is similar to the supply-side subsidy that Bitcoin used to
successfully scale its hardware security. Longer term, we anticipate BAL will
need to find a [recurring model of value
capture](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a479ee3b7411c6102f75729/t/5cc4ad03f5a50f00010525e7/1556393220303/Value+Capture+and+Quantification_+Cryptocapital+vs+Cryptocommodities_Final.pdf)
to capitalize the network sustainably over time. Holders will also determine
the final BAL supply, though they are limited by a 100M token hard-cap
(current supply at ~35M, with weekly distributions to liquidity providers
growing supply over time).

 _What the future looks like for Balancer_

Balancer’s growth to date only scratches the surface of the potential of
dynamic liquidity pools. For those who find 8-asset pools not enough, Balancer
allows pool parameters to be controlled and updated by a smart contract, an
individual, or an organization like a DAO. This encompasses a considerable
range of programmability. Some examples of pool types that are possible with
dynamic Balancer pools include:

  * Liquidity pools that [grow both liquidity and staking participation.](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/5/22/proof-of-liquidity)

  * Community-governed pools, such as those in [PieDAO](https://piedao.org/#/) whose[ USD++ pool](https://twitter.com/PieDAO_DeFi/status/1272886281031344130?s=20) regularly adjusts weights to favor stablecoins that exhibit lower volatility.

  * [Rollover pools](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/defi-discussions/41) that can turn expiring assets such as bonds into perpetual tokens.

  * Pools that can be programmed to [replicate financial derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08806). For example, users can hold LP shares with payoffs that approximate options.

  * [Liquidity bootstrapping pools](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution-a49d4286e0d4) that enable teams to build early liquidity with little initial capital, while gradually decreasing slippage and exposure. This can serve for primary asset issuance, as well as bolstering secondary-market liquidity if markets already exist for the asset.

  * Surge pricing pools that increase fees during times of high demand for liquidity, such as Black Thursday. This attracts more liquidity to the surge pricing pool as it becomes more profitable than a fixed-fee pool. In turn, this allows for better trades with lower slippage, as there is now more liquidity available.

At Placeholder we believe open protocols will form the basis of a [superior
financial system](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/6/13/a-superior-
financial-system), and to that end have invested in minimally extractive but
highly defensible protocols, as well as in [applications
atop](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2019/12/3/zerion) these protocols. This
model lowers costs for service providers, and enables an [opt-in relationship
between users and
applications](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/1/30/thin-applications).
Balancer is a great example of a powerful protocol within this paradigm, and
we expect many more ingenious applications to emerge atop the protocol,
attracting fresh capital and liquidity to Balancer.

While Balancer’s elegance and extensibility immediately drew us to the
protocol, it was the core team’s talent and authenticity that won us over.
Fernando, a longtime Maker community member dreamed up the math behind
Balancer; he recruited Nikolai, the original architect of MakerDAO to help him
build it; and then brought on Mike McDonald, creator of[
mkr.tools](https://mkr.tools/) to make it all happen. The team has expanded
since and is hiring senior smart contract engineers as it builds Balancer v2,
so if you’re interested shoot an email to contact@balancer.finance !

[1]  If the composition of the pool deviates from its target weights as
traders source assets from the pools, then arbitrageurs are incentivized to
adjust the weights back to target. In this way, investors ensure that their
portfolio will be consistently set at desired percentages of portfolio value,
without having to do any rebalancing themselves.

[2] Liquidity providers lose some value to arbitrage during rebalancing, which
the trading fees are designed to offset. For a full analysis of the trade-offs
to contributing liquidity to Balancer pools, refer to [this
